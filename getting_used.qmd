# Getting used to R and R Studio



 Don't forget `library(tidyverse)` first if you need it (you probably will).

## Using R Studio on your own computer

This is not required now, but you may wish to do this now or later so that you are not fighting for resources on the `r.datatools` server at busy times (eg. when an assignment is due).

Follow the instructions [here](http://ritsokiguess.site/lecture-notes/running.html#/installing-r-on-your-own-computer) to install R Studio on your computer, then start R Studio (which itself starts R).

Once you have this working, you can use it for any of the following questions, in almost exactly the same way as the online R (I will explain any differences).
