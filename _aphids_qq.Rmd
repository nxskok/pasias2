##  Killing aphids


 An experiment was designed to examine how well the insecticide rotenone kills
aphids that feed on the chrysanthemum plant called *Macrosiphoniella sanborni*. 
The explanatory variable is the log concentration (in milligrams per litre) of the
insecticide. At each of the five different concentrations,
approximately 50 insects were exposed. The number of insects exposed
at each concentration, and the number killed, are shown below.


```

Log-Concentration   Insects exposed    Number killed   
0.96                       50              6               
1.33                       48              16              
1.63                       46              24              
2.04                       49              42              
2.32                       50              44

(a) Get these data into R. You can do this by copying the data
into a file and reading that into R (creating a data frame), or you
can enter the data manually into R using `c`, since there are
not many values. In the latter case, you can create a data frame or
not, as you wish. Demonstrate that you have the right data in R.
 

(b) <a name="part:expo">*</a> Looking at the data, would you expect there to be a
significant effect of log-concentration? Explain briefly.
 


(c) Run a suitable logistic regression, and obtain a summary of
the results. (There was a part (c) here before, but I took it out.)

 

(d) Does your analysis support your answer to (<a href="#part:expo">here</a>)?
Explain briefly.

 

(e) Obtain predicted probabilities of an insect's being killed at
each of the log-concentrations in the data set. 

(f) Obtain a plot of the predicted probabilities of an insect's being killed, as it depends on the log-concentration.
 

(g) People in this kind of work are often interested in the
"median lethal dose". In this case, that would be the
log-concentration of the insecticide that kills half the
insects. Based on your predictions, roughly what do you think the
median lethal dose is?
