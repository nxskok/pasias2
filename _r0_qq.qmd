##  Getting started


 This question is to get you started using R.


(a) Start R Studio, in some project. (If you started up a
new project in the previous question and still have that open, use
that; if not, create a new project.)


(b) We're going to do some stuff in R here, just to get used to
it. First, make a Quarto document by selecting File, New File and Quarto Document. 


(c) The top four lines, surrounded by `---` above and below, are called
    a *YAML block*. This contains information about the document as a
    whole, and needs to be there. Go down to below that, moving the
    "Quarto" heading down a bit if you want. On an empty line, type a /
    and you should see a list of things appear that you might want to
    insert. Pressing Enter now will insert an R code chunk (sometimes
    called "code cell"). Do that.



(d) Type the line of code shown below into the code chunk in the
Quarto document:

```
mtcars
```



(e) Run this command. To do that, look at the top right of
your code chunk block (shaded in a slightly different colour). You
should see a down arrow and a green "play    button". 
Click the play button. This will run the code, and show
the output below the code chunk.


(f) Something a little more interesting: `summary`
obtains a summary of whatever you feed it (the five-number summary
plus the mean for numerical variables). Obtain this for our data
frame. To do this, create a new code chunk below the previous one,
type `summary(mtcars)` into the code chunk, and run it.


(g) Let's make a boxplot of the gas mileage data. This is a 
"poor man's boxplot"; we'll see a nicer-looking way later. To do it
this way, make another new code chunk, enter the code
`boxplot(mtcars$mpg)` into it, and run the chunk.


(h) Some aesthetics to finish with: delete the template document
(all the stuff you didn't type below your code chunks and
output). Then add some narrative text above and below your code
chunks. Above the code chunk is where you say what you are going
to do (and maybe why you are doing it), and below is where you say
what you conclude from the output you just obtained.


(i) Save your document (the usual way with File and Save). This
saves it *on the `r.datatools` server* (and not on your
computer, unless you are running R Studio on your computer). This means that when you come back to `r.datatools`
later, even from another device, this notebook will still be
available to you.
Now click Render. This produces a pretty HTML version of your
notebook.


(j) Optional extra: Practice handing in your rendered Quarto notebook, as if it were an assignment that was worth
something. (It is good to get the practice in a low-stakes
situation, so that you'll know what to do next week.)


(k) Optional extra. Something more ambitious: make a scatterplot of gas
mileage `mpg`, on the $y$ axis, against horsepower,
`hp`, on the $x$-axis.
