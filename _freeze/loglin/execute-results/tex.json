For each respondent, the researchers recorded the temperature of the laundry load (low or high), whether or not they previously used brand M (yes or no), and the softness of the water used for the laundry load(hard, medium or soft). The aim of the survey was to find out what was associated with the respondents preferring brand M.

For example, the first line says that 749 students were in the\nlower social stratum, received low encouragement and have no college\nplans. If we sum up the frequencies, we should get 5199 because there\nwere that many students altogether:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwisc %>% summarize(tot = sum(frequency))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 x 1\n    tot\n  <dbl>\n1  5199\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(b) Fit a log-linear model containing all possible\ninteractions.

Hint: `update`.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nIn this kind of modelling, it's easier to describe what changes\nshould be  made to get from one model to another, rather than\nwriting out the whole thing from scratch again.\nAnyway, the three-way interaction can come out:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwisc.2 <- update(wisc.1, . ~ . - social.stratum:encouragement:college.plans)\n```\n:::\n\n   \n\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(e) Continue to examine what can be removed, and if reasonable,\nremove it, until you need to stop.

There is\nnothing else we can remove. All the two-way interactions have to stay\nin the model.\n\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(f) Make two-way tables of any remaining two-way interactions, and\ndescribe any relationships that you see.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nWe have three two-way tables to make.\n\nMy first one is social stratum by parental encouragement. Neither of\nthese is really a response, but I thought that social stratum would\ninfluence parental encouragement rather than the other way around, hence:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxtabs(frequency ~ social.stratum + encouragement, data = wisc) %>%\n  prop.table(margin = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n              encouragement\nsocial.stratum      high       low\n   higher      0.8562249 0.1437751\n   lower       0.3182609 0.6817391\n   lowermiddle 0.2542373 0.7457627\n   uppermiddle 0.5584329 0.4415671\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nThis says that there tends to be more parental encouragement, the\nhigher the social stratum. \nNext, this:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxtabs(frequency ~ social.stratum + college.plans, data = wisc) %>%\n  prop.table(margin = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n              college.plans\nsocial.stratum         no        yes\n   higher      0.33654618 0.66345382\n   lower       0.85391304 0.14608696\n   lowermiddle 0.97072419 0.02927581\n   uppermiddle 0.66467463 0.33532537\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nIn this one (and the next), `college.plans` is the response, in\ncolumns, so we want to have the *rows* adding up to 1. \n\nThe higher the social stratum, the more likely is a male\nhigh school senior to have plans to go to college. (The social stratum\nis not in order, so you'll have to jump from the second row to the\nthird to the fourth to the first to assess this. Lower and lower\nmiddle are not in order, but the others are.)\n\nFinally, this:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxtabs(frequency ~ encouragement + college.plans, data = wisc) %>%\n  prop.table(margin = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n             college.plans\nencouragement        no       yes\n         high 0.4621590 0.5378410\n         low  0.9472265 0.0527735\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nAnd here you see an *enormous* effect of parental encouragement\non college plans: if it is low, the high-school senior is very\nunlikely to be considering college.\n\nNothing, in all honesty, that is very surprising here. But the two-way\ninteractions are easier to interpret than a three-way one would have\nbeen.\n\nHere, we think of college plans as being a response, and this\nanalysis has shown that whether or not a student has plans to go to\ncollege depends separately on the socio-economic status and the level\nof parental encouragement (rather than on the combination of both, as\nwould have been the case had the three-way interaction been\nsignificant). \n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  Predicting voting\n\n\n 1257 British voters were classified according\nto their social class, age (categorized), sex and the political party\nthey voted for (Labour or Conservative).

Do you now\nhave something that you need?\n\nSolution\n\n\nI changed my mind about how to do this from last year. Using\n`count` is alarmingly more direct than the method I had before:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvotes <- vote0 %>% count(class, age, sex, vote)\nvotes\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 58 x 5\n   class        age   sex    vote             n\n   <chr>        <chr> <chr>  <chr>        <int>\n 1 lower middle 26-40 female conservative    17\n 2 lower middle 26-40 female labour          13\n 3 lower middle 26-40 male   conservative    14\n 4 lower middle 26-40 male   labour          15\n 5 lower middle 41-50 female conservative    29\n 6 lower middle 41-50 female labour           4\n 7 lower middle 41-50 male   conservative    27\n 8 lower middle 41-50 male   labour          12\n 9 lower middle 51-75 female conservative    33\n10 lower middle 51-75 female labour           8\n# i 48 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n     \n\nExactly the right thing now: note the new column `n` with\nfrequencies in it. (Without a column of frequencies we can't fit a\nlog-linear model.) There are now only 58 combinations of the four\ncategorical variables, as opposed to 1247 rows in the original data\nset (with, inevitably, a lot of repeats).\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(c) Fit a log-linear model with the appropriate interaction (as a\nstarting point).\n\nSolution\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvote.1 <- glm(n ~ class * age * sex * vote, data = votes, family = \"poisson\")\n```\n:::\n\n     \n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(d) Refine your model by taking out suitable non-significant\nterms, in multiple steps.

This is a small effect, but\nI guess the large number of voters made it big enough to be significant.\n\nI took it this way around because `vote` is the outcome, and\ntherefore I want to address things \nlike \"if a voter is female, how likely are they to vote Labour\", \nrather than conditioning the other\nway around (which would \nbe \"if a voter voted Labour, how likely are they to be female\", \nwhich doesn't make nearly so much sense). \n\nThen the tricky one:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxt <- xtabs(n ~ vote + age + class, data = votes)\nxt\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n, , class = lower middle\n\n              age\nvote           <26 >75 26-40 41-50 51-75\n  conservative  22  17    31    56    54\n  labour        16   6    28    16    21\n\n, , class = upper middle\n\n              age\nvote           <26 >75 26-40 41-50 51-75\n  conservative  14  14    45    52    53\n  labour         9   0    21    13    17\n\n, , class = working\n\n              age\nvote           <26 >75 26-40 41-50 51-75\n  conservative  32  25    68    61    87\n  labour        67  19   133   145   115\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nDoing it this way has produced different subtables for each\n`class`. This is actually OK, because we can \nsay \"if a voter was of lower middle class\" and then talk about the relationship\nbetween age and vote, as if we were looking at a simple effect:\n\n\n\n* If a voter was of lower-middle-class, they strongly favour voting\nConservative in all age groups except for `<26` and 26--40.\n\n* If a voter was of upper-middle-class, they even more strongly favour\nvoting Conservative in all age groups except for \"under 26\" and\nmaybe 26--40.\n\n* If a voter was of Working class, they strongly favour voting\nLabour, except in the \n\"over 75\" age group (and maybe 51--75 as well).\n\n\nIf the anomalous age group(s) had been the same one every time, there\nwould no longer have been an interaction between age and class in\ntheir effect on `vote`.

The\nConservatives are like the Conservatives here (indeed, the nickname\n\"Tories\" comes from the UK; the Conservatives there were officially\nknown as the Tories many years ago). Many people are lifelong voters\nfor their party, and would never think of voting for the \"other side\", \nin the same way that many Americans vote either Democrat or\nRepublican without thinking about it too much. Our parliamentary\nsystem comes from the UK system (vote for a candidate in a riding, the\nleader of the party with the most elected candidates becomes Prime\nMinister), and a \"landslide\" victory often comes from persuading\nenough of the voters open to persuasion to switch sides. In the UK, as\nhere, the parties' share of the popular vote doesn't change all that\nmuch from election to election, even though the number of seats in\nParliament might change quite a lot.\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n\n\n## Brand M laundry detergent\n\n A survey was carried out comparing respondents' preferences of a laundry detergent M compared to a mystery brand X.

It was originally in a textbook, laid out like this:\n\n![](brand_m.jpg) \n\nThis is a common layout for frequency data, because it saves a lot of space. Multiple header rows are hard to deal with, though, so I combined the three column variables into one with a layout like this (aligned in columns):\n\n```\nsoftness no_low_x no_low_m no_high_x no_high_m yes_low_x yes_low_m yes_high_x yes_high_m\nhard        68       42        42       30         37        52        24        43\nmedium      66       50        33       23         47        55        23        47\nsoft        63       53        29       27         57        49        19        29\n```\n\nLet's read this in and then think about what to do with it:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprefs0 <- read_table(\"brand_m.txt\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\n-- Column specification ------------------------------------------------------------------\ncols(\n  softness = col_character(),\n  no_low_x = col_double(),\n  no_low_m = col_double(),\n  no_high_x = col_double(),\n  no_high_m = col_double(),\n  yes_low_x = col_double(),\n  yes_low_m = col_double(),\n  yes_high_x = col_double(),\n  yes_high_m = col_double()\n)\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprefs0\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 x 9\n  softness no_low_x no_low_m no_high_x no_high_m yes_low_x yes_low_m yes_high_x yes_high_m\n  <chr>       <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>      <dbl>      <dbl>\n1 hard           68       42        42        30        37        52         24         43\n2 medium         66       50        33        23        47        55         23         47\n3 soft           63       53        29        27        57        49         19         29\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nWe want to get all those frequencies into one column, which suggest some kind of `pivot_longer.`There are two ways to go about this. One is to try a regular `pivot_longer`and see what happens. I had to think for a moment about what to call the column that ended up as `combo`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprefs0 %>% pivot_longer(-softness, names_to = \"combo\", values_to = \"frequency\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 24 x 3\n   softness combo      frequency\n   <chr>    <chr>          <dbl>\n 1 hard     no_low_x          68\n 2 hard     no_low_m          42\n 3 hard     no_high_x         42\n 4 hard     no_high_m         30\n 5 hard     yes_low_x         37\n 6 hard     yes_low_m         52\n 7 hard     yes_high_x        24\n 8 hard     yes_high_m        43\n 9 medium   no_low_x          66\n10 medium   no_low_m          50\n# i 14 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThis is the right kind of shape, but those things in the column `combo` are three variables all smooshed together: respectively, previous user (of brand M), temperature, preference (you can tell by the values, which are all different). These can be split up with `separate`, thus:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprefs0 %>% pivot_longer(-softness, names_to = \"combo\", values_to = \"frequency\") %>% \nseparate(combo, into = c(\"prev_user\", \"temperature\", \"preference\"), sep = \"_\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 24 x 5\n   softness prev_user temperature preference frequency\n   <chr>    <chr>     <chr>       <chr>          <dbl>\n 1 hard     no        low         x                 68\n 2 hard     no        low         m                 42\n 3 hard     no        high        x                 42\n 4 hard     no        high        m                 30\n 5 hard     yes       low         x                 37\n 6 hard     yes       low         m                 52\n 7 hard     yes       high        x                 24\n 8 hard     yes       high        m                 43\n 9 medium   no        low         x                 66\n10 medium   no        low         m                 50\n# i 14 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThat works, but the combination of `pivot_longer` and `separate` is a common one, and so there is an \"advanced\" version of `pivot_longer` that does it all at once.

(Do *not* use `step`; do the elimination yourself).\n\nSolution\n\n\nThe first step is to fit a model containing all the interactions between the factors, using `frequency` as the response, and then to use `drop1` with `test=\"Chisq\"` to see what can come out. Don't forget the `family = \"poisson\"`, since that's what drives the modelling. I tnink it's easiest to number these models, since there might be a lot of them:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprefs.1 <- glm(frequency~softness*m_user*temperature*prefer, family = \"poisson\", data=prefs)\ndrop1(prefs.1, test = \"Chisq\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nSingle term deletions\n\nModel:\nfrequency ~ softness * m_user * temperature * prefer\n                                   Df Deviance    AIC     LRT Pr(>Chi)\n<none>                                 0.00000 180.41                 \nsoftness:m_user:temperature:prefer  2  0.73732 177.15 0.73732   0.6917\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nTo our relief, the four-way interaction is not significant and can be removed. (I was *not* looking forward to the prospect of interpreting that!)\n\nNow write an `update` line that removes that four-way interaction from your model, as shown below, and copy-paste your `drop1` line from above, changing  the number  of your model to the one coming out of `update`. Copy-paste the complicated interaction from the `drop1` output:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprefs.2 <- update(prefs.1, .~.-softness:m_user:temperature:prefer)\ndrop1(prefs.2, test = \"Chisq\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nSingle term deletions\n\nModel:\nfrequency ~ softness + m_user + temperature + prefer + softness:m_user + \n    softness:temperature + m_user:temperature + softness:prefer + \n    m_user:prefer + temperature:prefer + softness:m_user:temperature + \n    softness:m_user:prefer + softness:temperature:prefer + m_user:temperature:prefer\n                            Df Deviance    AIC    LRT Pr(>Chi)\n<none>                           0.7373 177.15                \nsoftness:m_user:temperature  2   2.1146 174.53 1.3773   0.5022\nsoftness:m_user:prefer       2   5.3086 177.72 4.5713   0.1017\nsoftness:temperature:prefer  2   0.8991 173.31 0.1618   0.9223\nm_user:temperature:prefer    1   2.9594 177.37 2.2220   0.1361\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThere are now four three-way interactions that could be removed.

finally we are done! There are three two-way interactions left, which shouldn't be too hard to interpret. That's in the next part.\n\n\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n\n(c) What is associated with the brand a  respondent prefers? By obtaining suitable frequency tables, describe the nature of these associations.\n\nSolution\n\n\nTo see what is associated with brand preference, look for significant associations with `prefer`. There are two of them, one with `m_user`, and, separately, one with temperature. This means that a respondent's brand preference depends on whether or not they previously used brand M, and also on what temperature the laundry was washed at.\n\nTo investigate these, use `xtabs` to get a frequency table (easiest), and if necessary use `prop.table` to get row or column proportions as appropriate. The first thing in the model formula in `xtabs` is the frequency column; the first thing after the squiggle is rows and the second thing is columns. (If there happened to be a third thing, it would be \"layers\" in the table.) You might find that the table of frequencies is enough to interpret what is going on, but if not, use `prop.table` to get a table of proportions. I talk about that in a moment.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxt <- xtabs(frequency ~ m_user + prefer, data = prefs)\nxt\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      prefer\nm_user   m   x\n   no  225 301\n   yes 275 207\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n`prefer` is the response (outcome), which I put in the columns, so I look along the rows to see what is going on. Out of the people who were previous users of Brand M (second row), slightly more of them preferred Brand M; out of the people who were not Brand M users (first row), somewhat more of them preferred Brand X.\n\nThis was not hard to see, because the opposite frequencies were bigger each time. But you might find it easier to compute percentages and compare those. In my table, the response was rows, so the right percentages to compute are *row* ones. That is done like this. 1 is rows, 2 is columns:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprop.table(xt, margin = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      prefer\nm_user         m         x\n   no  0.4277567 0.5722433\n   yes 0.5705394 0.4294606\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nOut of the people who were previous Brand M users, 57% preferred Brand M; out of the people who were not previous Brand M users, only 43% of them preferred Brand M. \n\nAdvertisers use terms like \"brand familiarity\" to capture ideas like this: more people prefer Brand M in the survey if they have used it before. Not altogether surprising. \n\n\nOn to the effects of temperature on preference:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxt <- xtabs(frequency ~ temperature + prefer, data = prefs)\nxt\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           prefer\ntemperature   m   x\n       high 199 170\n       low  301 338\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprop.table(xt, margin = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           prefer\ntemperature         m         x\n       high 0.5392954 0.4607046\n       low  0.4710485 0.5289515\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nOut of the people who used a high-temperature wash, 54% of them preferred brand M, but out of the people who used a low-temperature wash, only 47% of them preferred brand M.\n\nI'm making it seem like this is a big difference, and of course it's a very small one, but the size of the survey makes even this tiny difference significant. \n\nThose are really the two effects of interest, since they are the ones associated with brand preference. But there was one more association that was significant: between temperature and softness. The softness in this case was of the water used to do the laundry (and not, for example, the softness of the clothes after they come out of the dryer). That goes like this:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxt <- xtabs(frequency ~ temperature + softness, data = prefs)\nxt\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           softness\ntemperature hard medium soft\n       high  139    126  104\n       low   199    218  222\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprop.table(xt, margin = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           softness\ntemperature      hard    medium      soft\n       high 0.4112426 0.3662791 0.3190184\n       low  0.5887574 0.6337209 0.6809816\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nI decided to condition on the softness of the water, since that cannot be controlled by the person doing the laundry (the water just *is* hard or soft, depending on where you live and where your water comes from). \n\nIn each case, a majority of the washes were done at low temperature, but the softer the water, the bigger that majority was. Once again, the effect is not all that big, because the association was only just significant.\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n",
