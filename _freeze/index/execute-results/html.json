These come from my courses STAC32, STAC33, and STAD29 at the University of\nToronto Scarborough. \n\nYou will occasionally\nsee question parts beginning with a *; this means that other question\nparts refer back to this one. (One of my favourite question strategies\nis to ask how two different approaches lead to the same answer, or\nmore generally to demonstrate that there are different ways to see the\nsame thing.)\n\nThanks to Dann Sioson for spotting some errors and making some useful suggestions.\n\nIf *you* see anything, [file an\nissue](https://github.com/nxskok/pasias2/issues) on the Github page for\nnow. Likely\nproblems include:\n\n- some LaTeX construction that I didn't catch (eg. block quotes)\n- disappeared footnotes (that will show up as an apparently missing sentence in the text)\n- references to \"in class\" or a lecture or a course by course number, which need to be eliminated (in favour of wording like \"a previous course\")\n- references to other questions or question parts that are *wrong* (likely caused by *not* being \"labels\" or \"refs\" in the original LaTeX)\n- my contorted English that is difficult to understand.\n\nAs I read through looking for problems like these, I realize that\nthere ought to be a textbook that reflects my way of doing\nthings. There isn't one (yet), though there are lecture\nnotes. Current versions of these are at:\n\n- [the STAC32 website](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC32/)\n- [the STAC33 website](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAC33/)\n- [the STAD29 website](http://ritsokiguess.site/STAD29/)\n\nA little background:\n\nSTAC32 is an introduction to R as\napplied to statistical methods that have (mostly) been learned in\nprevious courses. This course is designed for students who have a second non-mathematical applied statistics course \nsuch as\n[this](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/stab27h3). The idea is\nthat students have already seen a little of regression and analysis of\nvariance (and the things that precede them), and need mainly an\nintroduction of how to run them in R.\n\nSTAC33 is an introduction to R, and applied statistics in general, for students who have a background in mathematical statistics. The way our courses are structured, these students have a strong mathematical background, but not very much experience in applications, which this course is designed to provide. The material covered is similar to STAC32, with a planned addition of some ideas in bootstrap and practical Bayesian statistics. There are some questions on these here.\n\nSTAD29 is an overview of a number of advanced statistical methods. I\nstart from regression and proceed to some regression-like methods\n(logistic regression, survival analysis, log-linear frequency table\nanalysis), then I go a little further with analysis of variance and\nproceed with MANOVA and repeated measures. I finish with a look at\nclassical multivariate methods such as discriminant analysis, cluster\nanalysis, principal components and factor analysis. I cover a number\nof methods in no great depth; my aim is to convey an understanding of\nwhat these methods are for, how to run them and how to interpret the\nresults. Statistics majors and specialists cannot take this course for\ncredit (they have separate courses covering this material with the\nproper mathematical background). D29 is intended for students in other\ndisciplines who find themselves wanting to learn more statistics; we\nhave an [Applied Statistics Minor\nprogram](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/minor-program-applied-statistics-science)\nfor which C32 and D29 are two of the last courses.\n\n## Packages used somewhere in this book {-}\n\nThe bottom lines are below used with the `conflicted` package: if a function by\nthe name shown is in two or more packages, prefer the one from the\npackage shown.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(smmr)\nlibrary(MASS)\nlibrary(nnet)\nlibrary(survival)\nlibrary(survminer)\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(lme4)\nlibrary(ggbiplot)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(rpart)\nlibrary(bootstrap)\nlibrary(cmdstanr)\nlibrary(posterior)\nlibrary(bayesplot)\nlibrary(tmaptools)\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(conflicted)\nconflict_prefer(\"summarize\", \"dplyr\")\nconflict_prefer(\"select\", \"dplyr\")\nconflict_prefer(\"filter\", \"dplyr\")\nconflict_prefer(\"mutate\", \"dplyr\")\nconflict_prefer(\"count\", \"dplyr\")\nconflict_prefer(\"arrange\", \"dplyr\")\nconflict_prefer(\"rename\", \"dplyr\")\nconflict_prefer(\"id\", \"dplyr\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nAll of these packages are on CRAN, and may be installed via the usual `install.packages`, with the exceptions of:\n\n- `smmr` on Github: install with \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndevtools::install_github(\"nxskok/smmr\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n- `ggbiplot` on Github: install with \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndevtools::install_github(\"vqv/ggbiplot\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n- `cmdstanr`, `posterior`, and `bayesplot`: install with\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"cmdstanr\", \n                 repos = c(\"https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/\", \n                           getOption(\"repos\")))\ninstall.packages(\"posterior\", \n                 repos = c(\"https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/\", \n                            getOption(\"repos\")))\ninstall.packages(\"bayesplot\", \n                 repos = c(\"https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/\", \n                            getOption(\"repos\")))\n```\n:::\n",
