This is formed by the water vapour in clouds combining\nwith nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide, which come from coal and oil\nproduction. How does the acidity of rain affect the acidity of the\nsoil on which it falls? (This will have an effect on the kind of\nplants that can be grown in that soil.) Acidity is measured using the\npH scale, where a pH of 7 is chemically neutral, a number less than 7\nis acidic, and a number greater than 7 is alkaline.\n\nAn experiment was conducted at the Florida Institute of Food and\nAgricultural Sciences, to determine how acidity of rain affects soil\nacidity. Experimental plots were irrigated with rainwater that was\nprepared to have one of two different pH levels, 3.7 and 4.5. The\nacidity of the soil was then measured at three different depths,\n0--15, 15--30, and 30--46 centimetres. This was done on three\ndifferent dates, in April and June 1991. The data are in\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/acidrain.csv).\n\n\n\n(a) Read in and display the data.\n\n\n(b) Draw a grouped boxplot to show how soil acidity depends on\nthe pH of the rain and the soil depth. (The first time you do this\nyou might not get the boxplot you want. How can you fix that?)\n\n\n(c) What does your grouped boxplot say about likely\ninteractions? Explain briefly.\n\n\n(d) Fit an ANOVA with interaction. What do you conclude from\nit? You may want to create a column that is the factor version of\n`rain_pH` first.\n\n\n\n\n\n##  Treating hay fever\n\n\n Hay fever is an allergic reaction to things like grasses or\npollen which can make it unpleasant to go outside when the weather is\nat its best.  A research lab is developing a new compound to relieve\nsevere cases of hay fever. There were two active ingredients, labelled\nA and B, with each one having three levels, low, medium and\nhigh. There were thus $3\\times 3=9$ treatment combinations. 36\nsubjects were available, and these were randomly assigned to\ncombinations of levels of factor A and factor B, so that each\ncombination was tested on 4 people. The response variable was the\nnumber of hours of relief from symptoms (so a higher value is\nbetter). The data are in\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/hayfever.txt).\n\n\n\n(a) Read the data and display its structure. Verify that you\nhave what you were expecting.\n\n\n(b) Calculate the mean hours of relief for each combination of\nlevels of the two active ingredients. Save your results in a data\nframe and display that.\n\n\n(c) Make an interaction plot, showing how the mean pain relief depends on the combination of levels of A and B. It is probably easiest to use the data frame you obtained in the previous part.\n\n\n(d) What do you conclude from your interaction plot? Explain briefly.\n\n\n(e) Run an analysis of variance with interaction. What do you conclude?\n\n\n(f) Analyze the simple effects of B when A is\n`medium`. (This means doing an appropriate `aov` and\nan appropriate Tukey, if warranted.)\n\n\n(g) Analyze the simple effects of B when A is `high`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  Focused comparisons of the effect of caffeine\n\n\n \nDoes caffeine help students do better on a certain test? To\nfind out, 36 students were randomly allocated to three groups (12 in\neach group).  Each student received a fixed number of cups of coffee\nwhile they were studying, but the students didn't know whether they\nwere receiving all full-strength coffee (\"high\"), all decaf coffee\n(\"low\") or a 50-50 mixture of the two (\"moderate\"). For each\nsubject, their group was recorded as well as their score on the\ntest. The data are in\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/caffeine.csv), as a\n`.csv` file.\n\nThis time we look at\ncontrasts. Suppose I knew ahead of time\nthat I wanted to compare moderate caffeine with high, and any\ncaffeine with none. (In the latter case, we're comparing \n\"no caffeine\" against the average of the other two groups.)\n\nIn the previous go-through of the caffeine data, we\ndiscovered that `amount` was actually text rather than a\nfactor, but we also discovered that it *didn't matter*. Here it\ndoes matter, so the first thing we have to do is to re-do the\n`pivot_longer`, creating a factor version of `amount`.\n\n\n\n(a) Read in the data again, from\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/caffeine.csv), and\ndisplay it. This is the untidy format, so name it appropriately:\n\n\n\n(b) Copy your `pivot_longer` from before, only this time add\n`names_ptypes = list(amount=factor())` to the end of it. Take a look at the\nresults. What has changed from before?\n\n\n\n(c) Using the newly tidied caffeine data, run the ANOVA \n*as a  regression* (that is, using `lm`). Look at the\n`summary` of the output. What do you see?\n\n\n\n(d) Obtain the different values of `amount`, in the order\nthat R has them.\n\n\n\n(e) Create a contrast that compares High with Moderate, ignoring\nNone. That is, create a vector whose length is the same as the\nnumber of levels of `amount`, and which has a 1 to represent\nHigh and a $-1$ to represent Moderate. \n\n\n\n(f) Create a contrast that compares \"any caffeine\" against\n\"none\" by comparing None against the average of Moderate and High.\n\n\n\n(g) Verify that your two contrasts are orthogonal.\n\n\n\n(h) Arrange your contrasts as columns of a matrix (using\n`cbind`), and say that you want to use these as contrasts for\n`amount` (in data frame `caffeine` or whatever you\ncalled it).\n\n\n\n(i) Fit the ANOVA as an `lm`, and look at the\n`summary`. What do you conclude about your contrasts?\n\n\n\n(j) What happens if you try to use high caffeine vs.\\ moderate\ncaffeine and moderate vs.\\ none as your two contrasts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  Who studies the most outside class?\n\n\n A social scientist wanted to see how many hours students\n studied outside of class. She took a random sample of 75 students\n from three different majors: math, social science and English, and\n recorded the number of weekly outside-class study hours for each\n student. The data can be found at\n [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/studyhours.txt). The\n social scientist had two research questions: whether math students study\n more outside of class than the other students, and whether English and\n social science students study different amounts of time outside class.\n\n\n(a) Explain briefly why contrasts would be a better idea here\nthan ANOVA with Tukey.\n\n\n\n(b) Read in the data and make side-by-side boxplots of study\nhours by major. What do the boxplots suggest about the comparisons\nthat the researcher wants to make?\n\n\n\n(c) Set up contrasts for each of the researcher's research\nquestions, bearing in mind the levels of `major` and the\norder in which they come. (For the `Math` contrast, you want\nMath against the average of the other two.)\n\n\n\n(d) Verify that your two contrasts are orthogonal.\n\n\n\n(e) Create a matrix of contrasts (using `cbind`) and let\n`lm` know that these are contrasts for `major`, in\ndata frame `studyhours` (or whatever you called it).\n\n\n\n(f) Fit the model using `lm`. What do you conclude about\nyour contrasts?\n\n\n\n(g) Are you surprised by the significance or non-significance you\nfound in the previous part? Explain briefly.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n##  Mental context\n\n\n It is believed that being in the same mental context for\nlearning and for testing leads to better test scores. An experiment\nwas carried out to test this. During the learning phase, subjects\nlearned a list of 80 words in a room painted orange and decorated with\nposters, paintings and other paraphernalia.^[This is a fancy  word for *stuff*.] A memory test was given to all subjects\nimmediately after they had learned the words, to give the impression\nthat the experiment was over. (The results of this test were\ndiscarded.) One day later, subjects were unexpectedly re-tested under\ndifferent experimental conditions and asked to write down all the\nwords of the original list that they could remember. The re-test took\nplace in five different conditions, which subjects were randomly\nallocated to one of:\n\n\n\n* Same context: in the original orange-painted room.\n\n* Different context: in a very different room, painted grey and\nlocated in a different part of campus.\n\n* Imaginary context: in the grey room, but subjects are asked to\nremember the orange room in which they took the original test. To\nhelp them with this, the experimenter begins by asking them several\nquestions about the orange room and the objects in it.\n\n* Photographed context: in the grey room, but subjects are shown\nphotographs of the orange room.\n\n* Placebo context: in the grey room, with subjects first being\nasked to recall their living room.\n\n\nIn each case, the response variable was the number of words on the\noriginal list successfully recalled by each subject.\n\n50 subjects in total completed the experiment, 10 under each of the 5\nconditions. \n\nThe researchers had four research hypotheses to test with the data:\n\n\n\n* Groups where the context matches (is the same, or is simulated\nby imagining or photograph) will perform better than groups with\ndifferent or placebo contexts.\n\n* The group with the same context will differ from the group with\nimaginary or photographed contexts.\n\n\n* The imaginary-context group will differ from the\nphotographed-context group.\n\n* The different-context group will differ from the placebo-context group.\n\n\nThe research hypotheses are (as is usual) written as\n*alternative* hypotheses. We can rewrite them as null\nhypotheses, with some extra wording to facilitate converting them\ninto contrasts, like this:\n\n\n* The mean of the `same`, `imaginary` and\n`photograph` groups (group means) is equal to the mean of the\n`different` and `placebo` groups (group means).\n\n* The mean of the `imaginary` and `photograph`\ngroups is equal to the (mean of the) `same` group.\n\n* The `imaginary` and the `photograph` groups will\nhave the same mean.\n\n* The `different` and the `placebo` groups will\nhave the same mean.\n\nThe data are in\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/smith.txt) (the\noriginal researcher's name was Smith). \n\n\n(a) Read in the data and verify that you have a column called\n`context` that is text and a column called\n`words` that is a (whole) number.\n\n\n\n(b) Turn `context` into a `factor`, within the\ndata frame. (We are going to be doing contrasts). Display how the\ndata frame now looks.\n\n\n\n(c) What are the names of the five contexts in the data set\n(just display them),\nand what order are they in?\n\n\n\n(d) Write each of the four research hypotheses (in the\nnull-hypothesis versions) as R vectors that can be used to make\ncontrasts. (This will mean getting the contexts in the right\norder. If you get stuck, do the last two first, since they're\neasiest. The first one is actually the hardest.)\n\n\n\n(e) Pick two of your contrasts (doesn't matter which two) and\ndemonstrate that they are orthogonal.\n\n\n\n(f) Collect your contrasts together into a matrix, and\ntell `lm` that these are the contrasts for `context`.\n\n\n\n(g) Fit a model with `lm`, and display the results.\n\n\n\n(h) For each of the original research hypotheses, what do you\ninfer about them?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  Trying on shirts\n\n\n Does it make a difference if you see somebody else trying on\na shirt before you do, and if so, does it matter what kind of person\nit is? \n\nAn experiment was carried out in a university bookstore, with\nstudents who wanted to try on a shirt serving as (unsuspecting)\nexperimental subjects. When a student wanted to try on a shirt, the\nsales associate told them that there was only one shirt left, and it\nwas being tried on by an \"other customer\". This \"other customer\"\nwas actually a \"confederate\" of the experimenter (that means, they\nwere pretending to be a real customer but were actually part of the\nexperiment). The \"other customer\" was always female: either an\nattractive well-dressed model, or an average-looking student wearing\njeans. The \"other customer\" would come out of the\ndressing room and hand the shirt to the sales associate, who would\ngive it to the student who wanted to try it on. When the student had\ntried on the shirt, they were asked to rate it on a 7-point scale (on\nfive different dimensions, and those five scores were then\naveraged). Does a student's evaluation depend on whether the student\nwas male or female, and whether the \"other customer\" was a model or\na student? There was also a control group, where the student was\nhanded the shirt directly  by the sales associate, without the \n\"other customer\" being involved at all. \n\nThere were thus five treatments:\nmale students who saw a model, male students who saw a student, female\nstudents who saw a model, female students who saw a student, and the\ncontrol group. There were 25 students in each treatment group.\n\nThe data from this experiment can be found at\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/shirts.csv).\n\n\n\n(a) Read in and display the data. How many observations do you\nhave, and is that what you should have?\n\n\n(b) Turn `treatment` into a `factor` in your data\nframe. (You can use the same name as the text `treatment`\nthat you read in from the file.)\n\n\n(c) List the treatments in the order that they are in within\nyour `factor`. (There are lots of ways to do this; any one of\nthem except for `distinct` is good.)\n\n\n(d) <a name=\"part:mean-eval\">*</a> \nObtain a table of mean evaluation scores for each treatment group.\n  \n\n\n(e) The experimenters wanted to compare four specific things in\ntheir analysis:\n\n\n* evaluation scores between male students who saw a (female) model and\nmale students who saw a (female) student\n\n* evaluation scores between female students who saw a (female)\nmodel and female students who saw a (female) student\n\n* evaluation scores for male and for female students (overall)\n\n* evaluation scores for the (average of the) four genuine\ntreatments and for the control group\n\nCreate contrasts, with suitable names, using vectors with\nappropriate values.\n  \n\n\n(f) Pick two of your contrasts (doesn't matter which two) and\ndemonstrate that they are orthogonal.\n  \n\n\n(g) Collect all your contrasts together into a matrix and\ndeclare that they are contrasts for `treatment` within your\ndata frame (whatever you called it).\n  \n\n\n(h) Predict evaluation score from \ntreatment *as a  regression*, and display the results.\n  \n\n\n(i) For each of your contrasts, assess whether or not it is\nsignificant, and explain briefly what that means in the context of the\ndata. If a contrast is significant, use your answer to\npart (<a href=\"#part:mean-eval\">here</a>) to help in your interpretation. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy solutions follow:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Acid rain\n\nOne of the first noticeable effects of climate change was \"acid rain\".\nThis is formed by the water vapour in clouds combining with nitrous\noxide and sulfur dioxide, which come from coal and oil production. How\ndoes the acidity of rain affect the acidity of the soil on which it\nfalls? (This will have an effect on the kind of plants that can be grown\nin that soil.)

Experimental plots were irrigated with rainwater that was\nprepared to have one of two different pH levels, 3.7 and 4.5. The\nacidity of the soil was then measured at three different depths, 0--15,\n15--30, and 30--46 centimetres. This was done on three different dates,\nin April and June 1991.

You'll note that we\nhave one soil acidity value per combination of the other things (it was\na designed experiment).\n\nWe're going to ignore the date for now, treating the observations on\ndifferent dates as replicates.\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(b) Draw a grouped boxplot to show how soil acidity depends on the pH of\n    the rain and the soil depth. (The first time you do this you might\n    not get the boxplot you want. How can you fix that?)\n\nSolution\n\nThe problem is likely to be that either your `x` or your `fill` for your\nboxplot is numerical (`rain_pH` is `dbl`) rather than the categorical\nvariable you need. Try to use one of the explanatory variables as `x`\nand the other one as `fill` (or `colour`):\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(acidrain, aes(x = rain_pH, y = soil_acidity, fill = soil_depth)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](anova-revisited_files/figure-pdf/acidrain-2-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\nThat looks as if it worked, but it didn't. See the boxplot below for how\nit's supposed to be. I need `x` for the boxplot needs to be categorical.\nThe easiest way to make it such is to wrap it in `factor`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(acidrain, aes(x = factor(rain_pH), y = soil_acidity, fill = soil_depth)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](anova-revisited_files/figure-pdf/acidrain-3-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\nEven though `soil_depth` looks like numbers, the printout of the data\nframe reveals that it is text, so that is OK.\n\nIf you prefer, exchange `x` and `fill`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(acidrain, aes(fill = factor(rain_pH), y = soil_acidity, x = soil_depth)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](anova-revisited_files/figure-pdf/acidrain-4-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(c) What does your grouped boxplot say about likely interactions?\n    Explain briefly.\n\nSolution\n\nThink about the effect of one of your explanatory variables, for each\nlevel of the other. For example, in the last plot, the effect of the\nrain pH pm on the soil acidity is very small at the largest and smallest\ndepths, but at the middle soil depth 15--30, the average (median) soil\nacidity is a lot less when the rain pH is *higher* (which seems odd to\nme). The effect of rain pH being different according to soil pH is what\nsuggests an interaction effect. Another way of thinking about this is\nimagining what an interaction plot would look like. This would be a\ntrace going through the middle (strictly, mean rather than median) of\neach set of boxplots of one colour. In the last boxplot, the red trace\nwould go close to straight across, while the blue one would dip in the\nmiddle. Not parallel, so suggesting an interaction. Either approach is\ngood.\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(d) Fit an ANOVA with interaction. What do you conclude from it? You may\n    want to create a column that is the factor version of `rain_pH`\n    first.\n\nSolution\n\nFollowing my own hint:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nacidrain <- acidrain %>% mutate(frph = factor(rain_pH))\nsoil.1 <- aov(soil_acidity ~ frph * soil_depth, data = acidrain)\nsummary(soil.1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nfrph             1 0.0304 0.03042   0.759  0.401\nsoil_depth       2 0.0671 0.03357   0.838  0.457\nfrph:soil_depth  2 0.0078 0.00391   0.097  0.908\nResiduals       12 0.4810 0.04008               \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThe interaction is nowhere near significant, perhaps surprisingly. But\nbear in mind that there are only 18 observations in total, so each box\non the boxplot is based on *three* observations only. So the interaction\nwould have to be a lot bigger to be significant.\n\nThe usual procedure after finding a non-significant interaction is to\ntake it out:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsoil.2 <- update(soil.1, . ~ . - frph:soil_depth)\nsummary(soil.2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)\nfrph         1 0.0304 0.03042   0.871  0.366\nsoil_depth   2 0.0671 0.03357   0.962  0.406\nResiduals   14 0.4888 0.03492               \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThe P-values have come down a bit (the result of gaining two df for\nerror while the error SS only got a tiny bit bigger), but not nearly\nenough to be significant.\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Treating hay fever\n\nHay fever is an allergic reaction to things like grasses or pollen which\ncan make it unpleasant to go outside when the weather is at its best. A\nresearch lab is developing a new compound to relieve severe cases of hay\nfever. There were two active ingredients, labelled A and B, with each\none having three levels, low, medium and high. There were thus\n$3\\times 3=9$ treatment combinations. 36 subjects were available, and\nthese were randomly assigned to combinations of levels of factor A and\nfactor B, so that each combination was tested on 4 people.

It depends on how much variability\nthere is in the data, which the interaction plot doesn't show. Another\nidea is to add the data to the interaction plot, colour-coded in the\nsame way. I would do this by taking out the `geom_point` for the means\nand add one instead for the data, taken from the original data frame:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(d2, aes(x = a, y = m, colour = b, group = b)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point(data = hayfever, aes(y = relief))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](anova-revisited_files/figure-pdf/swaub-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\nTechnique: for that last `geom_point`, put in anything that changes: a\nnew data frame, and a new `y` for the plot, but the `x` and `colour` and\n`group` are the same as they were before, so I don't need to specify\nthem.\n\nThe points are *very* close to the lines, so there is almost no residual\nvariability. This makes it more convincing that the interaction is real\nand will be significant. A grouped boxplot shows the same thing:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(hayfever, aes(x = fct_inorder(a), y = relief, fill = fct_inorder(b))) + geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](anova-revisited_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(e) Run an analysis of variance with interaction.

Since each of our contrasts `c.hm` and\n`c.mn` have 3 things in them (3 groups), we need to add a\n\"dummy\" 3rd contrast to give us a $3\\times 3$ array of numbers:^[Which we are going to invert, as a matrix.

There are two special pieces of notation, both of which I use here: leaving the row or column slot blank means all the rows or all the columns, and using a negative row or column number means all the rows or columns except the one(s) named. Thus my notation here is all the rows, and all the columns except for the first one.

The\nmedian study times for the English and social science students\nwere similar, so it is not at all surprising that this difference\nfailed to be significant.\n\nWhen you set up contrasts, *these* are the tests you are\ninterested in, so there is no reason for following up with\nTukey or anything else. But you have to be able to say ahead of\ntime which contrasts you want to test. This is in\ncontrast^[In contrast. Get it? No? Well, never mind then.] to Tukey, where you don't have to decide\nwhich comparisons interest you until right at the end.\n\nAnother question you might have had is \n\"how many contrasts can I do\"? To answer this, go back and look at the ANOVA table. If\nyou run an ANOVA using `lm`, you get the ANOVA table by\npassing the fitted model object into `anova` rather than\n`summary`:^[`anova` is one of R's  multi-purpose tools; what it does depends on what you feed it.]\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nanova(studyhours.1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: hours\n          Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(>F)    \nmajor      2 198.96   99.48  8.3737 0.0005375 ***\nResiduals 72 855.36   11.88                      \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n        \n\nTwo degrees of freedom for `major`, so we can do 2\ncontrasts.

If we were only\ninterested in how math students compared with the rest, we could test\nit this way.\n\nOr, we could relabel the students as \"math\" and \"other\" and just\ndo a two-sample $t$-test. To do this, we need to delve into\n`forcats` (which is a part of the `tidyverse`). It deals\nwith categorical variables which are genuine factors, which we haven't\nhad much cause to do so far. But now we do. What we want to do is to\n*recode* the levels of `major`, which is done by\n`fct_recode`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstudyhoursx <- studyhours %>%\n  mutate(mathrest = fct_recode(major,\n    \"rest\" = \"english\",\n    \"rest\" = \"socsci\"\n  ))\nstudyhoursx %>% count(mathrest)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 x 2\n  mathrest     n\n  <fct>    <int>\n1 rest        50\n2 math        25\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nThe way `fct_recode` works is that you first give a factor,\nhere `major`, then you define a list of new levels in terms of\nthe old ones. We want a student whose major is either English or\nSocial Science to end up in the new not-math group that we'll call\n`rest`, so we need two lines inside `fct_recode`, one\nthat says that the new `rest` group includes the old\n`english` majors, and another that says that `rest` also\nincludes the old `socsci` majors. Any levels not mentioned\n(here `math`) are left unchanged.\n\nI did this wrong the first time: I got the things before and after the\n`=` in `fct_recode` the wrong way around.\n\nThe last line is to check that the result makes sense. I previously\nhad 25 students in each major. Now I have 25 students for whom\n`mathrest` is `math` (the math majors) and $50=25+25$\nstudents for whom `mathrest` is `rest` (everyone else). \n\nNow, the $t$-test.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(hours ~ mathrest, data = studyhoursx, var.equal = T)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tTwo Sample t-test\n\ndata:  hours by mathrest\nt = -3.7269, df = 73, p-value = 0.0003796\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group rest and group math is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -4.880528 -1.479472\nsample estimates:\nmean in group rest mean in group math \n              6.26               9.44 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nThis is very close to, but not the same as, the test with the contrasts,\nbecause we are not quite testing the same thing.

(Not\nclear? Well, it's not that clear to me either.)\n\nThat business with the `var.equal=T`? This is doing a pooled\n$t$-test. I did that here because the ANOVA is assuming equal spreads\nwithin the groups (which is what a pooled $t$-test does) and I thought\nI should do my best to be consistent.

An experiment\nwas carried out to test this. During the learning phase, subjects\nlearned a list of 80 words in a room painted orange and decorated with\nposters, paintings and other paraphernalia.^[This is a fancy  word for *stuff*.] A memory test was given to all subjects\nimmediately after they had learned the words, to give the impression\nthat the experiment was over. (The results of this test were\ndiscarded.) One day later, subjects were unexpectedly re-tested under\ndifferent experimental conditions and asked to write down all the\nwords of the original list that they could remember. The re-test took\nplace in five different conditions, which subjects were randomly\nallocated to one of:\n\n\n\n* Same context: in the original orange-painted room.\n\n* Different context: in a very different room, painted grey and\nlocated in a different part of campus.\n\n* Imaginary context: in the grey room, but subjects are asked to\nremember the orange room in which they took the original test. To\nhelp them with this, the experimenter begins by asking them several\nquestions about the orange room and the objects in it.\n\n* Photographed context: in the grey room, but subjects are shown\nphotographs of the orange room.\n\n* Placebo context: in the grey room, with subjects first being\nasked to recall their living room.\n\n\nIn each case, the response variable was the number of words on the\noriginal list successfully recalled by each subject.\n\n50 subjects in total completed the experiment, 10 under each of the 5\nconditions. \n\nThe researchers had four research hypotheses to test with the data:\n\n\n\n* Groups where the context matches (is the same, or is simulated\nby imagining or photograph) will perform better than groups with\ndifferent or placebo contexts.\n\n* The group with the same context will differ from the group with\nimaginary or photographed contexts.\n\n\n* The imaginary-context group will differ from the\nphotographed-context group.\n\n* The different-context group will differ from the placebo-context group.\n\n\nThe research hypotheses are (as is usual) written as\n*alternative* hypotheses. We can rewrite them as null\nhypotheses, with some extra wording to facilitate converting them\ninto contrasts, like this:\n\n\n* The mean of the `same`, `imaginary` and\n`photograph` groups (group means) is equal to the mean of the\n`different` and `placebo` groups (group means).\n\n* The mean of the `imaginary` and `photograph`\ngroups is equal to the (mean of the) `same` group.\n\n* The `imaginary` and the `photograph` groups will\nhave the same mean.\n\n* The `different` and the `placebo` groups will\nhave the same mean.\n\nThe data are in\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/smith.txt) (the\noriginal researcher's name was Smith). \n\n\n(a) Read in the data and verify that you have a column called\n`context` that is text and a column called\n`words` that is a (whole) number.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nThe usual thing --- read in the data appropriately and look at the\ndata frame you got:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_url <- \"http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/smith.txt\"\nsmith <- read_delim(my_url, \" \")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 50 Columns: 3\n-- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------\nDelimiter: \" \"\nchr (1): context\ndbl (2): id, words\n\ni Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\ni Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsmith\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 50 x 3\n      id context words\n   <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>\n 1     1 same       25\n 2     2 same       26\n 3     3 same       17\n 4     4 same       15\n 5     5 same       14\n 6     6 same       17\n 7     7 same       14\n 8     8 same       20\n 9     9 same       11\n10    10 same       21\n# i 40 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n       \n\n`dbl` actually means \"decimal number\", but these look like whole numbers, so I think we are good.\n      \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(b) Turn `context` into a `factor`, within the\ndata frame.

After that, it didn't matter how it was\ndone: being in the original room was not different from\nimagining the original room (by thinking about it or seeing a\nphoto of it). Failing to recall the original room was equally\nbad, whether the subjects were in a different room and not asked\nto think about the original orange room, or whether they were\nliterally asked to think about another room entirely.\n\nContrasts enabled us to tackle this problem and gain a very clear\nconclusion: recalling the original orange room is helpful, but\nit doesn't matter how you do it.\n\nHow big of a difference does thinking about the orange room\nmake? You can use the 2 SE thing to get a 95\\% confidence interval:\nthe difference in the (mean of the) recall-orange-room means and\nthe (mean of the) don't-recall means is between about 4.6 and\n12.6 words (out of 80). I leave it for you to decide whether\nthat is practically important as well as being statistically significant.\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Trying on shirts\n\nDoes it make a difference if you see somebody else trying on a shirt\nbefore you do, and if so, does it matter what kind of person it is?\n\nAn experiment was carried out in a university bookstore, with students\nwho wanted to try on a shirt serving as (unsuspecting) experimental\nsubjects. When a student wanted to try on a shirt, the sales associate\ntold them that there was only one shirt left, and it was being tried on\nby an \"other customer\". This \"other customer\" was actually a\n\"confederate\" of the experimenter (that means, they were pretending to\nbe a real customer but were actually part of the experiment). The \"other\ncustomer\" was always female: either an attractive well-dressed model, or\nan average-looking student wearing jeans. The \"other customer\" would\ncome out of the dressing room and hand the shirt to the sales associate,\nwho would give it to the student who wanted to try it on. When the\nstudent had tried on the shirt, they were asked to rate it on a 7-point\nscale (on five different dimensions, and those five scores were then\naveraged). Does a student's evaluation depend on whether the student was\nmale or female, and whether the \"other customer\" was a model or a\nstudent? There was also a control group, where the student was handed\nthe shirt directly by the sales associate, without the \"other customer\"\nbeing involved at all.\n\nThere were thus five treatments: male students who saw a model, male\nstudents who saw a student, female students who saw a model, female\nstudents who saw a student, and the control group. There were 25\nstudents in each treatment group.\n\nThe data from this experiment can be found at\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/shirts.csv).\n\n(a) Read in and display the data.

The table\n    of means reveals that the male average was higher, mostly because\n    males *really* liked the shirt when they thought the model had been\n    wearing it!\n\n-   There is no significant difference overall between treatment and\n    control groups in terms of average score. (This is mostly because\n    the treatment groups differ among themselves, with the scores for\n    students who saw the model being higher and those for students who\n    saw the female student being lower than for the control group.)\n\nIt is enough, on the non-significant ones, to say what it is that the\ncontrast is testing, and then to note that it is not significant. On the\nsignificant ones, I want you to say what is higher than what. You can\nalso get these conclusions from the `lm` output, but it requires a bit\nmore care:\n\n-   I set up `c_mms` with the score for the students who had seen the\n    model as plus and those who saw the student as minus. My slope here\n    is positive, so the score for male students who saw the model is\n    higher.\n\n-   My slope for `c_fms` is also positive, and I set this one up the\n    same way with model as positive and student as negative, so the\n    female students rated the shirt higher (but not significantly\n    higher) when they saw the model.\n\n-   My `c_mf` slope is significantly negative. I set up this contrast\n    with females as plus and males as minus, so this means males gave a\n    significantly *higher* score on average (for reasons discussed\n    above).\n\n-   The last slope is very close to 0, consistent with there being no\n    difference (on average) between treatment and control.\n\nPerhaps the story to get from this analysis is that male students are\n*such* suckers!\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n",
