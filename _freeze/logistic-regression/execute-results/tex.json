They hypothesized that it had to do with the size of the\ngrains of sand on the beach. They went to 28 beaches in Japan,\nmeasured the average sand grain size (in millimetres), and observed\nthe presence or absence of this particular spider on each beach. The\ndata are in [link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/spiders.txt). \n\n\n\n(a) Why would logistic regression be better than regular\nregression in this case?\n \n\n(b) Read in the data and check that you have something\nsensible. (Look at the data file first: the columns are aligned.)\n \n\n(c) Make a boxplot of sand grain size according to whether the\nspider is present or absent. Does this suggest that sand grain size\nhas something to do with presence or absence of the spider?\n \n\n(d) Fit a logistic regression predicting the presence or\nabsence of spiders from the grain size, and obtain its\n`summary`. Note that you will need to do something with the\nresponse variable first.\n \n\n(e) Is there a significant relationship between grain size and\npresence or absence of spiders at the $\\alpha=0.10$ level? Explain briefly.\n \n\n(f) Obtain predicted probabilities of spider presence\nfor a representative collection of grain sizes.\nI only want predicted probabilities, not\nany kind of intervals.\n \n\n(g) Given your previous work in this question, does the trend\nyou see in your predicted probabilities surprise you? Explain briefly.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n##  Killing aphids\n\n\n An experiment was designed to examine how well the insecticide rotenone kills\naphids that feed on the chrysanthemum plant called *Macrosiphoniella sanborni*. \nThe explanatory variable is the log concentration (in milligrams per litre) of the\ninsecticide. At each of the five different concentrations,\napproximately 50 insects were exposed. The number of insects exposed\nat each concentration, and the number killed, are shown below.\n\n\n```\n\nLog-Concentration   Insects exposed    Number killed   \n0.96                       50              6               \n1.33                       48              16              \n1.63                       46              24              \n2.04                       49              42              \n2.32                       50              44              \n\n```\n\n\n\n\n(a) Get these data into R. You can do this by copying the data\ninto a file and reading that into R (creating a data frame), or you\ncan enter the data manually into R using `c`, since there are\nnot many values. In the latter case, you can create a data frame or\nnot, as you wish. Demonstrate that you have the right data in R.\n \n\n(b) <a name=\"part:expo\">*</a> Looking at the data, would you expect there to be a\nsignificant effect of log-concentration? Explain briefly.\n \n\n\n(c) Run a suitable logistic regression, and obtain a summary of\nthe results. (There was a part (c) here before, but I took it out.)\n\n \n\n(d) Does your analysis support your answer to (<a href=\"#part:expo\">here</a>)?\nExplain briefly.\n\n \n\n(e) Obtain predicted probabilities of an insect's being killed at\neach of the log-concentrations in the data set. \n\n(f) Obtain a plot of the predicted probabilities of an insect's being killed, as it depends on the log-concentration.\n \n\n(g) People in this kind of work are often interested in the\n\"median lethal dose\". In this case, that would be the\nlog-concentration of the insecticide that kills half the\ninsects. Based on your predictions, roughly what do you think the\nmedian lethal dose is?\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n##  The effects of Substance A\n\n\n In a dose-response experiment, animals (or\ncell cultures or human subjects) are exposed to some toxic substance,\nand we observe how many of them show some sort of response. In this\nexperiment, a mysterious Substance A is exposed at various doses to\n100 cells at each dose, and the number of cells at each dose that\nsuffer damage is recorded. The doses were 10, 20, ... 70 (mg), and\nthe number of damaged cells out of 100 were respectively 10, 28, 53,\n77, 91, 98, 99.\n\n\n\n(a) Find a way to get these data into R, and show that you have\nmanaged to do so successfully.\n\n\n\n(b) Would you expect to see a significant effect of dose for\nthese data?\nExplain briefly.\n\n\n\n(c) Fit a logistic regression modelling the probability of a\ncell being damaged as it depends on dose. Display the\nresults. (Comment on them is coming later.)\n\n\n\n(d) Does your output indicate that the probability of damage\nreally does *increase* with dose? (There are two things here:\nis there really an effect, and which way does it go?)\n\n\n\n(e) Obtain predicted damage probabilities for some representative doses. \n\n\n\n(f) Draw a graph of the predicted probabilities, and to that add the observed proportions of damage at each dose. Hints: you will have to calculate the observed proportions first. See [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/marginaleffects/articles/mfx01_predictions.html), near the bottom, to find out how to add data to one of these graphs. The `geom_point` line is the one you need.\n\nLooking at  the predicted probabilities, would you say that\nthe model fits well? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  What makes an animal get infected?\n\n\n Some animals got infected with a parasite. We are interested\nin whether the likelihood of infection depends on any of the age,\nweight and sex of the animals. The data are at\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/infection.txt). The\nvalues are separated by tabs.\n\n\n\n(a) Read in the data and take a look at the first few lines. Is\nthis one animal per line, or are several animals with the same age,\nweight and sex (and infection status) combined onto one line? How\ncan you tell?\n \n\n(b) <a name=\"part:plot\">*</a> Make suitable plots or summaries of `infected` against\neach of the other variables. (You'll have to think about\n`sex`, um, you'll have to think about the `sex`\nvariable, because it too is categorical.) Anything sensible is OK\nhere. You might like to think back to what we did in\nQuestion <a href=\"#q:wolfspider\">here</a> for inspiration. (You can also\ninvestigate `table`, which does cross-tabulations.)\n \n\n(c) Which, if any, of your explanatory variables appear to be\nrelated to `infected`? Explain briefly.\n \n\n(d) Fit a logistic regression predicting `infected` from\nthe other three variables. Display the `summary`.\n \n\n(e) <a name=\"part:remove\">*</a> Which variables, if any, would you consider removing from\nthe model? Explain briefly.\n \n\n(f) Are the conclusions you drew in (<a href=\"#part:plot\">here</a>) and\n(<a href=\"#part:remove\">here</a>) consistent, or not? Explain briefly.\n \n\n(g) <a name=\"part:crossing\">*</a>\nThe first and third quartiles of `age` are 26 and 130;\nthe first and third quartiles of `weight` are 9 and 16. Obtain predicted probabilities for all combinations of these and\n`sex`. (You'll need to start by making a new data frame, using\n`datagrid` to get all the combinations.)\n \n \n\n\n\n\n##  The brain of a cat\n\n\n A large number (315) of psychology students were asked to\nimagine that they were serving on a university ethics committee\nhearing a complaint against animal research being done by a member of\nthe faculty. The students were told that the surgery consisted of\nimplanting a device called a cannula in each cat's brain, through\nwhich chemicals were introduced into the brain and the cats were then\ngiven psychological tests. At the end of the study, the cats' brains\nwere subjected to histological analysis. The complaint asked that the\nresearcher's authorization to carry out the study should be withdrawn,\nand the cats should be handed over to the animal rights group that\nfiled the complaint. It was suggested that the research could just as\nwell be done with computer simulations.\n\nAll of the psychology students in the survey were told all of this. In\naddition, they read a statement by the researcher that no animal felt\nmuch pain at any time, and that computer simulation was *not* an\nadequate substitute for animal research. Each student was also given\n*one* of the following scenarios that explained the benefit of\nthe research:\n\n\n\n* \"cosmetic\": testing the toxicity of chemicals to be used in\nnew lines of hair care products.\n\n* \"theory\": evaluating two competing theories about the function\nof a particular nucleus in the brain.\n\n* \"meat\": testing a synthetic growth hormone said to potentially\nincrease meat production.\n\n* \"veterinary\": attempting to find a cure for a brain disease\nthat is killing domesticated cats and endangered species of wild cats.\n\n* \"medical\": evaluating a potential cure for a debilitating\ndisease that afflicts many young adult humans.\n\n\nFinally, each student completed two questionnaires: one that would assess their\n\"relativism\": whether or not they believe in universal moral\nprinciples (low score) or whether they believed that the appropriate\naction depends on the person and situation (high score). The second\nquestionnaire assessed \"idealism\": a high score reflects a belief\nthat ethical behaviour will always lead to good consequences (and thus\nthat  if a behaviour leads to any bad consequences at all, it is\nunethical).^[I get confused about the difference between morals  and ethics. [This is a very short description of that difference:] (http://smallbusiness.chron.com/differences-between-ethical-issues-moral-issues-business-48134.html). The basic idea is that morals are part of who you are, derived from religion, philosophy etc. Ethics are how you act in a particular situation: that is, your morals, what you believe, inform your ethics, what you do. That's why the students had to play the role of an  ethics committee, rather than a morals committee; presumably the researcher had good morals, but an ethics committee had to evaluate what he was planning to do, rather than his character as a person.]\n\nAfter being exposed to all of that, each student stated their decision\nabout whether the research should continue or stop.\n\nI should perhaps stress at this point that no actual cats were harmed\nin the collection of these data (which can be found as a `.csv`\nfile at\n[link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/datafiles/master/decision.csv)). The\nvariables in the data set are these:\n\n\n\n* `decision`: whether the research should continue or stop (response)\n\n* `idealism`: score on idealism questionnaire\n\n* `relativism`: score on relativism questionnaire\n\n* `gender` of student\n\n* `scenario` of research benefits that the student read.\n\n\nA more detailed discussion^(\"[If you can believe it.] of this\nstudy is at\n[link](http://core.ecu.edu/psyc/wuenschk/MV/Multreg/Logistic-SPSS.PDF). \n\n\n(a) Read in the data and check by looking at the structure of\nyour data frame that you have something sensible. *Do not* call\nyour data frame `decision`, since that's the name of one of\nthe variables in it.\n\n\n\n(b) Fit a logistic regression predicting\n`decision` from `gender`. Is there an effect of gender?\n\n\n\n(c) To investigate the effect (or non-effect) of\n`gender`, create a contingency table by feeding\n`decision` and `gender` into `table`. What does\nthis tell you?\n\n\n\n(d) <a name=\"part:whichprob\">*</a> Is your slope for `gender` in the previous logistic\nregression positive or negative? Is it applying to males or to females?\nLooking at the conclusions from your \ncontingency table, what probability does that mean your logistic\nregression is actually modelling?\n\n\n\n(e) Add the two variables `idealism` and\n`relativism` to your logistic regression. Do either or both of them add\nsignificantly to your model? Explain briefly.\n\n \n\n(f) Add the variable `scenario` to your model. That is,\nfit a new model with that variable plus all the others.\n\n\n\n(g) Use `anova` to compare the models with and without\n`scenario`. You'll have to add a `test=\"Chisq\"` to your\n`anova`, to make sure that the test gets done.\nDoes `scenario` make a difference or not, at $\\alpha=0.10$?\nExplain briefly.\n(The reason we have to do it this way is that\n`scenario` is a factor with five levels, so it has four slope\ncoefficients. To test them all at once, which is what we need to make\nan overall test for `scenario`, this is the way it has to be\ndone.) \n\n\n\n(h) Look at the `summary` of your model that contained\n`scenario`. Bearing in mind that the slope coefficient for\n`scenariocosmetic` is zero (since this is the first scenario\nalphabetically), which scenarios have the most positive and most\nnegative slope coefficients? What does that tell you about those\nscenarios' effects?\n\n \n\n(i) Describe the effects that having (i) a higher idealism score\nand (ii) a higher relativity score have on a person's probability of\nsaying that the research should stop. Do each of these increase or decrease\nthat probability? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  How not to get heart disease\n\n\n What is associated with heart disease? In a study, a large\nnumber of variables were measured, as follows:\n\n\n\n* `age` (years)\n\n* `sex` male or female\n\n* `pain.type` Chest pain type (4 values: typical angina,\natypical angina, non-anginal pain, asymptomatic)\n\n* `resting.bp` Resting blood pressure, on admission to hospital\n\n* `serum.chol` Serum cholesterol\n\n* `high.blood.sugar`: greater than 120, yes or no\n\n* `electro` resting electrocardiographic results (normal,\nhaving ST-T, hypertrophy)\n\n* `max.hr` Maximum heart rate\n\n* `angina` Exercise induced angina (yes or no)\n\n* `oldpeak` ST depression induced by exercise relative to\nrest. See [link](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ecg-library/st-segment/).\n\n* `slope` Slope of peak exercise ST segment. Sloping up,\nflat or sloping down\n\n* `colored` number of major vessels (0--3) coloured by fluoroscopy\n\n* `thal` normal, fixed defect, reversible defect\n\n* `heart.disease` yes, no (response)\n\n\nI don't know what most of those are, but we will not let that stand in\nour way. Our aim is to find out what variables are associated with\nheart disease, and what values of those variables give high\nprobabilities of heart disease being present. The data are in\n[link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/datafiles/master/heartf.csv).\n\n\n\n(a) Read in the data. Display the first few lines and convince\nyourself that those values are reasonable.\n\n\n\n(b) In a logistic regression, what probability will be\npredicted here? Explain briefly but convincingly. (Is each line of\nthe data file one observation or a summary of several?)\n\n\n\n(c) <a name=\"part:heart-first\">*</a> Fit a logistic regression predicting heart disease from\neverything else (if you have a column called `X` or\n`X1`, ignore that), and display the results.\n\n\n\n(d) Quite a lot of our explanatory variables are factors. To\nassess whether the factor as a whole should stay or can be removed,\nlooking at the slopes won't help us very much (since they tell us\nwhether the other levels of the factor differ from the baseline,\nwhich may not be a sensible comparison to make). To assess which\nvariables are candidates to be removed, factors included (properly),\nwe can use `drop1`. Feed `drop1` a fitted model and\nthe words `test=\"Chisq\"` (take care of the capitalization!)\nand you'll get a list of P-values. Which variable is the one that\nyou would remove first? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\n(e) I'm not going to make you do the whole backward elimination\n(I'm going to have you use `step` for that later), but do one\nstep: that is, fit a model removing the variable you think should be\nremoved, using `update`, and then run `drop1` again to\nsee which variable will be removed next.\n\n\n\n(f) Use `step` to do a backward elimination to find which\nvariables have an effect on heart disease. Display your final model\n(which you can do by saving the output from `step` in a\nvariable, and asking for the summary of that. In `step`,\nyou'll need to specify a starting model (the one from part\n(<a href=\"#part:heart-first\">here</a>)), the direction of elimination, and the test\nto display the P-value for (the same one as you used in\n`drop1`). (Note: the actual decision to keep or drop explanatory variables is based on AIC rather than the P-value, with the result that `step` will sometimes keep variables you would have dropped, with P-values around 0.10.)\n\n\n\n(g) Display the summary of the model that came out of `step`.\n\n\n\n(h) We are going to make a large number of predictions. Create and save\na data frame that contains predictions for all combinations of representative\nvalues for all the variables in the model that came out of\n`step`. By \"representative\" I mean all the values for a\ncategorical variable, and the five-number summary for a numeric\nvariable. (Note that you will get a *lot* of predictions.)\n\n\n\n\n(i) Find the largest predicted probability (which is the\npredicted probability of heart disease) and display all the\nvariables that it was a prediction for. \n\n\n\n(j) Compare the `summary` of the final model from\n`step` with your highest predicted heart disease\nprobability and the values of the other variables that make it\nup. Are they consistent?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  Successful breastfeeding\n\n\n A regular pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, and a\nbaby that is born at or before 33 weeks is called\n\"premature\". The number of weeks at which a baby is born is called\nits \"gestational age\". \nPremature babies are usually smaller than normal and\nmay require special care. It is a good sign if, when the mother and\nbaby leave the hospital to go home, the baby is successfully breastfeeding.\n\nThe data in\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/breastfeed.csv) are from\na study of 64 premature infants. There are three columns: the\ngestational age (a whole number of weeks), the number of babies of\nthat gestational age that were successfully breastfeeding when they\nleft the hospital, and the number that were not. (There were multiple\nbabies of the same gestational age, so the 64 babies are summarized in\n6 rows of data.)\n\n\n\n(a) Read the data into R and display the data frame.\n\n\n\n\n(b) Verify that there were indeed 64 infants, by having R do a\nsuitable calculation on your data frame that gives the right answer\nfor the right reason.\n\n\n\n(c) Do you think, looking at the data, that there is a\nrelationship between gestational age and whether or not the baby was\nsuccessfully breastfeeding when it left the hospital? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\n(d) Why is logistic regression a sensible technique to use\nhere? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\n(e) Fit a logistic regression to predict the probability that\nan infant will be breastfeeding from its gestational age. Show the\noutput from your logistic regression.\n\n\n\n(f) Does the significance or non-significance of the slope of\n`gest.age` surprise you? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\n(g) Is your slope (in the `Estimate` column) positive or\nnegative? What does that mean, in terms of gestational ages and\nbreastfeeding? Explain briefly.\n \n\n\n(h) Obtain the predicted probabilities that an infant will\nsuccessfully breastfeed for a representative collection of gestational ages.\n\n\n(i) Make a graph of the predicted probability that an infant will successfully breastfeed as it depends on gestational age.\n\n\n\n\n##  Making it over the mountains\n\n\n In 1846, the Donner party (Donner and Reed\nfamilies) left Springfield, Illinois for California in covered\nwagons. After reaching Fort Bridger, Wyoming, the leaders decided to\nfind a new route to Sacramento. They became stranded in the eastern\nSierra Nevada mountains at a place now called Donner Pass, when the\nregion was hit by heavy snows in late October. By the time the\nsurvivors were rescued on April 21, 1847, 40 out of 87 had died.\n\nAfter the rescue, the age and gender of each person in the party was\nrecorded, along with whether they survived or not. The data are in\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/donner.txt). \n\n\n\n(a) Read in the data and display its structure. Does that agree\nwith the description in the previous paragraph?\n\n\n\n(b) Make graphical or numerical summaries for each pair of\nvariables. That is, you should make a graph or numerical summary for\neach of \n`age` vs. `gender`, `age` vs.\\\n`survived` and `gender` vs. `survived`. In choosing the\nkind of graph or summary that you will use, bear in mind that\n`survived` and `gender` are factors with two\nlevels. \n\n\n\n(c) For each of the three graphs or summaries in the previous\nquestion, what do they tell you about the relationship between the\npair of variables concerned? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\n(d) Fit a logistic regression predicting survival from age and\ngender. Display the summary.\n\n\n\n(e) Do both explanatory variables have an impact on survival?\nDoes that seem to be consistent with your numerical or graphical\nsummaries? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\n\n(f) Are the men typically older, younger or about the same age as\nthe women? Considering this, explain carefully what the negative\n`gendermale` slope in your logistic regression means.\n\n\n\n\n(g) Obtain predicted probabilities\nof survival for each combination of some representative ages and of the two genders in this dataset.\n\n\n(h) Do your predictions support your conclusions from earlier\nabout the effects of age and gender? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  Who needs the most intensive care?\n\n\n The \"APACHE II\" is a scale for assessing patients who\narrive in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital. These are seriously\nill patients who may die despite the ICU's best attempts. APACHE\nstands for \"Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation\".^[As with many of these acronyms, you get the idea that the acronym came first and they devised some words to fit it.]\nThe scale score is calculated from several physiological measurements\nsuch as body temperature, heart rate and the Glasgow coma scale, as\nwell as the patient's age. The final result is a score between 0 and\n71, with a higher score indicating more severe health issues. Is it\ntrue that a patient with a higher APACHE II score has a higher\nprobability of dying?\n\nData from one hospital are in\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/apache.txt). The columns\nare: the APACHE II score, the total number of patients who had that\nscore, and the number of patients with that score who died.\n\n\n\n(a) Read in and display the data (however much of it\ndisplays). Why are you convinced that have the right thing?\n\n\n(b) Does each row of the data frame relate to one patient or\nsometimes to more than one? Explain briefly.\n\n\n(c) Explain why this is the kind of situation where you need a\ntwo-column response.\n\n(d) Fit a logistic regression to estimate the probability of\ndeath from the `apache` score, and display the results.\n\n\n(e) Is there a significant effect of `apache` score on the\nprobability of survival? Explain briefly.\n\n\n(f) Is the effect of a larger `apache` score to increase or to\ndecrease the probability of death? Explain briefly.\n\n\n(g) Obtain the predicted probability of death for a representative collection of the\n`apache` scores that were in the data set. Do your predictions behave as you would expect (from your earlier work)?\n\n\n(h) Make a plot of predicted death probability against\n`apache` score (joined by lines) with, also on the plot, the\nobserved proportion of deaths within each `apache` score,\nplotted against `apache` score. Does there seem to be good\nagreement between observation and prediction? Hint: calculate what you need to from the original dataframe first, save it, then make a plot of the predictions, and then to the plot add the appropriate thing from the dataframe you just saved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  Go away and don't come back!\n\n\n When a person has a heart attack and survives it, the major\nconcern of health professionals is to prevent the person having a\nsecond heart attack. Two factors that are believed to be important are\nanger and anxiety; if a heart attack survivor tends to be angry or\nanxious, they are believed to put themselves at increased risk of a\nsecond heart attack.\n\nTwenty heart attack survivors took part in a study. Each one was given\na test designed to assess their anxiety (a higher score on the test\nindicates higher anxiety), and some of the survivors took an anger\nmanagement course. \nThe data are in\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ha2.txt); `y` and\n`n` denote \"yes\" and \"no\" respectively. The columns denote\n(i) whether or not the person had a second heart attack, (ii) whether\nor not the person took the anger management class, (iii) the anxiety\nscore. \n\n\n\n(a) Read in and display the data.\n\n\n(b) <a name=\"part:fit\">*</a> \nFit a logistic regression predicting whether or not a heart attack\nsurvivor has a second heart attack, as it depends on anxiety score\nand whether or not the person took the anger management\nclass. Display the results.\n\n\n(c) In the previous part, how can you tell that you were\npredicting the probability of having a second heart attack (as\nopposed to the probability of not having one)?\n\n\n(d) <a name=\"part:preds\">*</a>\nFor the two possible values `y` and `n` of\n`anger` and the anxiety scores 40, 50 and 60, make a data\nframe containing all six combinations, and use it to obtain\npredicted probabilities of a second heart attack. Display your\npredicted probabilities side by side with what they are predictions\nfor.\n\n\n(e) Use your predictions from the previous part to describe the\neffect of changes in `anxiety` and `anger` on the\nprobability of a second heart attack.\n\n\n(f) Are the effects you described in the previous part\nconsistent with the `summary` output from `glm` that\nyou obtained in (<a href=\"#part:fit\">here</a>)? Explain briefly how they are, or\nare not. (You need an explanation for each of `anxiety` and\n`anger`, and you will probably get confused if you look at\nthe P-values, so don't.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy solutions follow:\n\n\n\n\n##  Finding wolf spiders on the beach\n\n\nA team of Japanese researchers were investigating what would\ncause the burrowing wolf spider *Lycosa ishikariana* to be found\non a beach. They hypothesized that it had to do with the size of the\ngrains of sand on the beach. They went to 28 beaches in Japan,\nmeasured the average sand grain size (in millimetres), and observed\nthe presence or absence of this particular spider on each beach.

This\nmight be because we don't have that much data: even though we have\n28 observations, which, on the face of it, is not a very small\nsample size, each observation doesn't tell us much: only whether\nthe spider was found on that beach or not. Typical sample sizes in\nlogistic regression are in the hundreds --- the same as for\nopinion polls, because you're dealing with the same kind of data.\nThe weak significance here lends some kind of weak support to the\nresearchers' hypothesis, but I'm sure they were hoping for\nsomething better.\n \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(f) Obtain predicted probabilities of spider presence\nfor a representative collection of grain sizes.\nI only want predicted probabilities, not\nany kind of intervals.\n \nSolution\n\nMake a data frame of values to predict from directly, using `tribble` or for that matter `datagrid`.

At each of the five different concentrations,\napproximately 50 insects were exposed. The number of insects exposed\nat each concentration, and the number killed, are shown below.\n\n\n```\n\nLog-Concentration   Insects exposed    Number killed   \n0.96                       50              6               \n1.33                       48              16              \n1.63                       46              24              \n2.04                       49              42              \n2.32                       50              44              \n\n```\n\n\n\n\n(a) Get these data into R. You can do this by copying the data\ninto a file and reading that into R (creating a data frame), or you\ncan enter the data manually into R using `c`, since there are\nnot many values. In the latter case, you can create a data frame or\nnot, as you wish. Demonstrate that you have the right data in R.\n \nSolution\n\n \nThere are a couple of ways. My\ncurrent favourite is the `tidyverse`-approved\n`tribble` method. A `tribble` is a \n\"transposed `tibble`\", in which you copy and paste the data,\ninserting column headings and commas in the right places. The\ncolumns don't have to line up, since it's the commas that\ndetermine where one value ends and the next one begins:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndead_bugs <- tribble(\n  ~log_conc, ~exposed, ~killed,\n  0.96, 50, 6,\n  1.33, 48, 16,\n  1.63, 46, 24,\n  2.04, 49, 42,\n  2.32, 50, 44\n)\ndead_bugs\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 x 3\n  log_conc exposed killed\n     <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl>\n1     0.96      50      6\n2     1.33      48     16\n3     1.63      46     24\n4     2.04      49     42\n5     2.32      50     44\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n    \n\nNote that the last data value has no comma after it, but instead has\nthe closing bracket of `tribble`.  \n\nYou can have extra spaces if you wish. They will just be ignored.\nIf you are clever in R\nStudio, you can insert a column of commas all at once (using\n\"multiple cursors\").\nI used to do it like this. I make vectors of each column using `c` and then glue the columns together into a data frame:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlog_conc <- c(0.96, 1.33, 1.63, 2.04, 2.32)\nexposed <- c(50, 48, 46, 49, 50)\nkilled <- c(6, 16, 24, 42, 44)\ndead_bugs2 <- tibble(log_conc, exposed, killed)\ndead_bugs2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 x 3\n  log_conc exposed killed\n     <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl>\n1     0.96      50      6\n2     1.33      48     16\n3     1.63      46     24\n4     2.04      49     42\n5     2.32      50     44\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n     \n\nThe values are correct --- I checked them.\n\nNow you see why `tribble` stands for \"transposed tibble\": if you want to construct a data frame by hand, you have to work with columns and then glue them together, but `tribble` allows you to work \"row-wise\" with the data as you would lay it out on the page.\n\nThe other obvious way to read the data values without typing them is to copy\nthem into a file and read *that*. The values as laid out are\naligned in columns. They might be separated by tabs, but they are\nnot.

So I would expect to see a strong, positive\neffect of concentration, and I would expect it to be strongly\nsignificant, especially since we have almost 250 insects altogether.\n \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n\n(c) Run a suitable logistic regression, and obtain a summary of\nthe results.\n\n \nSolution\n\n\nThis is one of those where each row of data is more than one individual (there were about 50 insects at each concentration), so the response variable needs to have two columns: one of how many insects were killed at that dose, and the other of how many insects survived. This is done using `cbind`. We don't actually have a number of insects that survived, but we know how many were exposed, so we can work out how many survived by doing a subtraction inside the `cbind`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbugs.1 <- glm(cbind(killed, exposed - killed) ~ log_conc, family = \"binomial\", data = dead_bugs)\nsummary(bugs.1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = cbind(killed, exposed - killed) ~ log_conc, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = dead_bugs)\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This is exactly what\nI guessed in (<a href=\"#part:expo\">here</a>), which I did before looking at the\nresults, honest!\n\nYou might also note that the Estimate for `log_conc` is positive and, by the standards of these things, pretty large in size, so the probability of being killed goes up pretty sharply as log-concentration increases.\n \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(e) Obtain predicted probabilities of an insect's being killed at\neach of the log-concentrations in the data set. \n\n \nSolution\n\nUse a `newdata` that is the original dataframe, and display only the columns of interest:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncbind(predictions(bugs.1, newdata = dead_bugs)) %>% \n  select(log_conc, exposed, killed, estimate)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  log_conc exposed killed  estimate\n1     0.96      50      6 0.1292158\n2     1.33      48     16 0.3191540\n3     1.63      46     24 0.5436313\n4     2.04      49     42 0.8099321\n5     2.32      50     44 0.9105221\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n \nThe advantage of this is that you can\ncompare the observed with the predicted. For example, 44 out of 50\ninsects were killed at log-dose 2.32, which is a proportion of 0.88,\npretty close to the prediction of 0.91.\n\n(f) Obtain a plot of the predicted probabilities of an insect's being killed, as it depends on the log-concentration.\n\nThis is `plot_predictions`, pretty much the obvious way:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_predictions(model = bugs.1, condition = \"log_conc\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\nThe thing I always forget is that the name of the explanatory variable has to be *in quotes*, which is not what we are used to from the `tidyverse`. The odd thing on the $y$-axis is our response variable; the predictions are the probability of being killed, which we could make our $y$-axis actually say, like this:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_predictions(model = bugs.1, condition = \"log_conc\") +\n  labs(y = \"Prob(killed)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs the log-concentration goes up, you can see how clearly the probability of the aphid being killed goes up. The confidence band is narrow because there is lots of data (almost 250 aphids altogether), and the confidence interval is much higher at the end than at the beginning, which is why the P-value came out so tiny.\n\n$\\blacksquare$ \n\n(g) People in this kind of work are often interested in the\n\"median lethal dose\". In this case, that would be the\nlog-concentration of the insecticide that kills half the\ninsects. Based on your predictions, roughly what do you think the\nmedian lethal dose is?\n\n \nSolution\n\nThis is probably easier to see from the graph, though the $x$-scale doesn't make it very easy to be accurate: look across to where the prediction crosses the probability of 0.5, which is somewhere between a log-concentration of 1.5 and 1.6.\n\nIf you go back and look at the predictions, the log-concentration of 1.63 is predicted to kill just over half\nthe insects, so the median lethal dose should be a bit less than\n1.63. It should not be as small as 1.33, though, since that\nlog-concentration only kills less than a third of the insects. So I\nwould guess somewhere a bit bigger than 1.5. Any guess somewhere in\nthis ballpark is fine: you really cannot be very accurate.\n\n\nExtra: this is kind of a strange prediction problem, because we know what\nthe *response* variable should be, and we want to know what the\nexplanatory variable's value is. Normally we do predictions the\nother way around.^[This kind of thing is sometimes called an inverse prediction.]\nSo the only way to get a more accurate figure is\nto try some different log-concentrations, and see which one gets\nclosest to a probability 0.5 of killing the insect.\n\nSomething like this would work:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnew <- datagrid(model = bugs.1, log_conc = seq(1.5, 1.63, 0.01))\ncbind(predictions(bugs.1, newdata = new))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   rowid  estimate   p.value    s.value  conf.low conf.high killed exposed\n1      1 0.4429568 0.1648944 2.60038599 0.3652634 0.5235451   26.4    48.6\n2      2 0.4506406 0.2274091 2.13663837 0.3729178 0.5308493   26.4    48.6\n3      3 0.4583480 0.3064263 1.70638797 0.3805961 0.5381827   26.4    48.6\n4      4 0.4660754 0.4030894 1.31082828 0.3882935 0.5455426   26.4    48.6\n5      5 0.4738191 0.5173536 0.95077748 0.3960050 0.5529261   26.4    48.6\n6      6 0.4815754 0.6476873 0.62663065 0.4037257 0.5603301   26.4    48.6\n7      7 0.4893406 0.7909629 0.33831808 0.4114509 0.5677514   26.4    48.6\n8      8 0.4971110 0.9426059 0.08527342 0.4191760 0.5751867   26.4    48.6\n9      9 0.5048827 0.9029843 0.14722716 0.4268962 0.5826324   26.4    48.6\n10    10 0.5126521 0.7518002 0.41157879 0.4346071 0.5900851   26.4    48.6\n11    11 0.5204154 0.6095000 0.71430197 0.4423044 0.5975408   26.4    48.6\n12    12 0.5281689 0.4807406 1.05666930 0.4499840 0.6049958   26.4    48.6\n13    13 0.5359087 0.3687072 1.43945232 0.4576417 0.6124460   26.4    48.6\n14    14 0.5436313 0.2749186 1.86292364 0.4652737 0.6198873   26.4    48.6\n   log_conc\n1      1.50\n2      1.51\n3      1.52\n4      1.53\n5      1.54\n6      1.55\n7      1.56\n8      1.57\n9      1.58\n10     1.59\n11     1.60\n12     1.61\n13     1.62\n14     1.63\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe closest one of these to a probability of 0.5 is 0.4971, which goes\nwith a log-concentration of 1.57: indeed, a bit bigger than 1.5 and a\nbit less than 1.63, and close to what I read off from my graph. The `seq` in the construction of the new\ndata frame is \"fill sequence\": go from 1.5 to 1.63 in steps of\n0.01.

There is uncertainty attached to it (because\nthe actual logistic regression might be different from the one we\nestimated), so we ought to provide a confidence interval for it. But\nI'm riding the bus as I type this, so I can't look it up right now.\n\nLater: there's a function called `dose.p` \nin `MASS` that appears to do this:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlethal <- dose.p(bugs.1)\nlethal\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n             Dose         SE\np = 0.5: 1.573717 0.05159576\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nWe have a sensible point estimate (the same 1.57 that we got by hand),\nand we have a standard error, so we can make a confidence interval by\ngoing up and down twice it (or 1.96 times it) from the estimate.

An idea that works more\ngenerally is to get several intervals all at once, say for the\n\"quartile lethal doses\" as well:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlethal <- dose.p(bugs.1, p = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))\nlethal\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n              Dose         SE\np = 0.25: 1.220327 0.07032465\np = 0.50: 1.573717 0.05159576\np = 0.75: 1.927108 0.06532356\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nThis looks like a data frame or matrix, but is actually a \n\"named vector\", so `enframe` will get at least some of this and turn\nit into a genuine data frame:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nenframe(lethal)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 x 2\n  name      value     \n  <chr>     <glm.dose>\n1 p = 0.25: 1.220327  \n2 p = 0.50: 1.573717  \n3 p = 0.75: 1.927108  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nThat doesn't get the SEs, so we'll make a new column by grabbing the \"attribute\" as above:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nenframe(lethal) %>% mutate(SE = attr(lethal, \"SE\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 x 3\n  name      value      SE[,1]\n  <chr>     <glm.dose>  <dbl>\n1 p = 0.25: 1.220327   0.0703\n2 p = 0.50: 1.573717   0.0516\n3 p = 0.75: 1.927108   0.0653\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nand now we make the intervals by making new columns containing the lower and upper limits:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nenframe(lethal) %>%\n  mutate(SE = attr(lethal, \"SE\")) %>%\n  mutate(LCL = value - 2 * SE, UCL = value + 2 * SE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 x 5\n  name      value      SE[,1] LCL[,1] UCL[,1]\n  <chr>     <glm.dose>  <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n1 p = 0.25: 1.220327   0.0703    1.08    1.36\n2 p = 0.50: 1.573717   0.0516    1.47    1.68\n3 p = 0.75: 1.927108   0.0653    1.80    2.06\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nNow we have intervals for the median lethal dose, as well as for the doses that kill a quarter and three quarters of the aphids.\n\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n \n\n\n\n\n\n##  The effects of Substance A\n\n\n In a dose-response experiment, animals (or\ncell cultures or human subjects) are exposed to some toxic substance,\nand we observe how many of them show some sort of response. In this\nexperiment, a mysterious Substance A is exposed at various doses to\n100 cells at each dose, and the number of cells at each dose that\nsuffer damage is recorded. The doses were 10, 20, ... 70 (mg), and\nthe number of damaged cells out of 100 were respectively 10, 28, 53,\n77, 91, 98, 99.\n\n\n\n(a) Find a way to get these data into R, and show that you have\nmanaged to do so successfully.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nThere's not much data here, so we don't need to create a file,\nalthough you can do so if you like (in the obvious way: type the\ndoses and damaged cell numbers into a `.txt` file or\nspreadsheet and read in with the appropriate `read_`\nfunction). \nOr, use a `tribble`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndr <- tribble(\n  ~dose, ~damaged,\n  10, 10,\n  20, 28,\n  30, 53,\n  40, 77,\n  50, 91,\n  60, 98,\n  70, 99\n)\ndr\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 x 2\n   dose damaged\n  <dbl>   <dbl>\n1    10      10\n2    20      28\n3    30      53\n4    40      77\n5    50      91\n6    60      98\n7    70      99\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n       \nOr, make a data frame with the values typed in:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndr2 <- tibble(\n  dose = seq(10, 70, 10),\n  damaged = c(10, 28, 53, 77, 91, 98, 99)\n)\ndr2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 x 2\n   dose damaged\n  <dbl>   <dbl>\n1    10      10\n2    20      28\n3    30      53\n4    40      77\n5    50      91\n6    60      98\n7    70      99\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\n`seq` fills a sequence \"10 to 70 in steps of 10\", or you can\njust list the doses.\n\n\nFor these, find a way you like, and stick with it.\n\n    \n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(b) Would you expect to see a significant effect of dose for\nthese data?\nExplain briefly.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nThe number of damaged cells goes up sharply as the dose goes up\n(from a very small number to almost all of them). So I'd expect\nto see a strongly significant effect of dose. This is far from\nsomething that would happen by chance.\n \n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(c) Fit a logistic regression modelling the probability of a\ncell being damaged as it depends on dose. Display the\nresults. (Comment on them is coming later.)\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nThis has a bunch of observations at each dose (100 cells, in\nfact), so we need to do the two-column response thing: the\nsuccesses in the first column and the failures in the\nsecond. This means that we need to calculate the number of\ncells at each dose that were not damaged, by subtracting the\nnumber that *were* damaged from 100. This is best done within the `glm`, so that everything is accessible to `plot_predictions` later.\n\n\n\nNow we fit our model:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncells.1 <- glm(cbind(damaged, 100 - damaged) ~ dose, family = \"binomial\", data = dr)\nsummary(cells.1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = cbind(damaged, 100 - damaged) ~ dose, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = dr)\n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

How does R know to subtract *each one* from 100?\" Well, R has what's known as\n\"recycling rules\": if you try to add or subtract (or elementwise\nmultiply or divide) two vectors of different lengths, it recycles the\nsmaller one by repeating it until it's as long as the longer one. So\nrather than `100-damaged` giving an error, it does what you\nwant.^[The usual application of this is to combine a number  with a vector. If you try to subtract a length-2 vector from a  length-6 vector, R will repeat the shorter one three times and do  the subtraction, but if you try to subtract a length-2 vector from a length-*7* vector, where you'd have to repeat the shorter one a fractional number of times, R will do it, but you'll get a warning, because this is probably *not* what you wanted. Try it and see.]\n\n    \n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(d) Does your output indicate that the probability of damage\nreally does *increase* with dose? (There are two things here:\nis there really an effect, and which way does it go?)\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nThe slope of `dose` is significantly nonzero (P-value\nless than $2.2 \\times 10^{-16}$, which is as small as it can\nbe). The slope itself is *positive*, which means that as\ndose goes up, the probability of damage goes up. \n\nThat's all I needed, but if you want to press on: the slope is\n0.113, so an increase of 1 in dose goes with an increase of\n0.113 in the *log-odds* of damage. Or it multiplies the\nodds of damage by $\\exp(0.113)$. Since 0.113 is small, this is\nabout $1.113$ (mathematically, $e^x\\simeq 1+x$ if $x$ is small),\nso that the increase is about 11\\%. \nIf you like, you can get a rough CI for the slope by going up\nand down twice its standard error (this is the usual\napproximately-normal thing).

We are interested\nin whether the likelihood of infection depends on any of the age,\nweight and sex of the animals. The data are at\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/infection.txt). The\nvalues are separated by tabs.\n\n\n\n(a) Read in the data and take a look at the first few lines. Is\nthis one animal per line, or are several animals with the same age,\nweight and sex (and infection status) combined onto one line? How\ncan you tell?\n \nSolution\n\n\nThe usual beginnings, bearing in mind the data layout:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_url <- \"http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/infection.txt\"\ninfect <- read_tsv(my_url)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 81 Columns: 4\n-- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------\nDelimiter: \"\\t\"\nchr (2): infected, sex\ndbl (2): age, weight\n\ni Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\ni Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninfect\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 81 x 4\n   infected   age weight sex   \n   <chr>    <dbl>  <dbl> <chr> \n 1 absent       2      1 female\n 2 absent       9     13 female\n 3 present     15      2 female\n 4 absent      15     16 female\n 5 absent      18      2 female\n 6 absent      20      9 female\n 7 absent      26     13 female\n 8 present     42      6 female\n 9 absent      51      9 female\n10 present     52      6 female\n# i 71 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nSuccess.\nThis appears to be one animal per line, since there is no indication\nof frequency (of \"how many\").

The other hint is that you have actual\ncategories of response, which usually indicates one individual per\nrow, but not always. If it doesn't, you have some extra work to do to\nbash it into the right format.\n\nExtra: let's see whether we can come up with an example of that. I'll make a\nsmaller example, and perhaps the place to start is \n\"all possible combinations\" of a few things. \n`crossing` is the same idea as `datagrid`, except that it doesn't need a model, and so is better for building things from scratch:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nd <- crossing(age = c(10, 12), gender = c(\"f\", \"m\"), infected = c(\"y\", \"n\"))\nd\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 8 x 3\n    age gender infected\n  <dbl> <chr>  <chr>   \n1    10 f      n       \n2    10 f      y       \n3    10 m      n       \n4    10 m      y       \n5    12 f      n       \n6    12 f      y       \n7    12 m      n       \n8    12 m      y       \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThese might be one individual per row, or they might be more than one,\nas they would be if we have a column of frequencies:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nd <- d %>% mutate(freq = c(12, 19, 17, 11, 18, 26, 16, 8))\nd\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 8 x 4\n    age gender infected  freq\n  <dbl> <chr>  <chr>    <dbl>\n1    10 f      n           12\n2    10 f      y           19\n3    10 m      n           17\n4    10 m      y           11\n5    12 f      n           18\n6    12 f      y           26\n7    12 m      n           16\n8    12 m      y            8\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nNow, these are multiple observations per row (the presence of\nfrequencies means there's no doubt about that), but the format is\nwrong: `infected` is my response variable, and we want the\nfrequencies of `infected` being `y` or `n` in\n*separate* columns --- that is, we have to *untidy* the data\na bit to make it suitable for modelling. This is `pivot_wider`, the\nopposite of `pivot_longer`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nd %>% pivot_wider(names_from=infected, values_from=freq)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 4 x 4\n    age gender     n     y\n  <dbl> <chr>  <dbl> <dbl>\n1    10 f         12    19\n2    10 m         17    11\n3    12 f         18    26\n4    12 m         16     8\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nNow you can pull out the columns `y` and `n` and make\nthem into your response, and predict that from `age` and\n`gender`. \n\nThe moral of this story is that if you are going to have multiple\nobservations per row, you probably want the combinations of\n*explanatory* variables one per row, but you want the categories\nof the *response* variable in separate columns.\n\nBack to where we were the rest of the way.\n \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(b) <a name=\"part:plot\">*</a> Make suitable plots or summaries of `infected` against\neach of the other variables. (You'll have to think about\n`sex`, um, you'll have to think about the `sex`\nvariable, because it too is categorical.) Anything sensible is OK\nhere. You might like to think back to what we did in\nQuestion <a href=\"#q:wolfspider\">here</a> for inspiration. (You can also\ninvestigate `table`, which does cross-tabulations.)\n \nSolution\n\n\nWhat comes to my mind for the numerical variables `age` and\n`weight` is boxplots:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(infect, aes(x = infected, y = age)) + geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/fodudu-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(infect, aes(x = infected, y = weight)) + geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/fodudu-2.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n     \n\nThe variables `sex` and `infected` are both\ncategorical. I guess a good plot for those would be some kind of\ngrouped bar plot, which I have to think about. \nSo let's first try a numerical summary, a\ncross-tabulation, which is gotten via `table`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwith(infect, table(sex, infected))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n        infected\nsex      absent present\n  female     17      11\n  male       47       6\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nOr, if you like the `tidyverse`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninfect %>% count(sex, infected)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 4 x 3\n  sex    infected     n\n  <chr>  <chr>    <int>\n1 female absent      17\n2 female present     11\n3 male   absent      47\n4 male   present      6\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nNow, bar plots. Let's start with one variable. The basic bar plot has\ncategories of a categorical variable along the $x$-axis and each bar\nis a count of how many observations were in that category. What is\nnice about `geom_bar` is that it will do the counting for you,\nso that the plot is just this:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(infect, aes(x = sex)) + geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/parasite-7-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nThere are about twice as many males as females.\n\nYou may think that this looks like a histogram, which it almost does,\nbut there is an important difference: the kind of variable on the\n$x$-axis. Here, it is a categorical variable, and you count how many\nobservations fall in each category (at least, `ggplot`\ndoes). On a histogram, the $x$-axis variable is a continuous\n*numerical* one, like height or weight, and you have to\n*chop it up* into intervals (and then you count how many\nobservations are in each chopped-up interval).\n\nTechnically, on a bar plot, the bars have a little gap between them\n(as here), whereas the histogram bars are right next to each other,\nbecause the right side of one histogram bar is the left side of the next.\n\nAll right, two categorical variables. The idea is that you have each\nbar divided into sub-bars based on the frequencies of a second\nvariable, which is specified by `fill`. Here's the basic idea:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(infect, aes(x = sex, fill = infected)) + geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/parasite-8-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nThis is known in the business as a \"stacked bar chart\". The issue is\nhow much of each bar is blue, which is unnecessarily hard to judge\nbecause the male bar is taller. (Here, it is not so bad, because the\namount of blue in the male bar is smaller and the bar is also\ntaller. But we got lucky here.)\n\nThere are two ways to improve this. One is known as a \"grouped bar chart\", which goes like this:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(infect, aes(x = sex, fill = infected)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/parasite-9-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nThe absent and present frequencies for females are next to each other,\nand the same for males, and you can read off how big they are from the\n$y$-scale. This is my preferred graph for two (or more than two)\ncategorical variables.\n\nYou could switch the roles of `sex` and `infected` and\nget a different chart, but one that conveys the same information. Try\nit. (The reason for doing it the way around I did is that being\ninfected or not is the response and `sex` is explanatory, so\nthat on my plot you can ask \"out of the males, how many were infected?\", \nwhich is the way around that makes sense.)\n\nThe second way is to go back to stacked bars, but make them the same\nheight, so you can compare the fractions of the bars that are each\ncolour. This is `position=\"fill\"`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(infect, aes(x = sex, fill = infected)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/parasite-10-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nThis also shows that more of the females were infected than the males,\nbut without getting sidetracked into the issue that there were more\nmales to begin with.\n\nI wrote this question in early 2017. At that time, I wrote:\n\n> I learned about this one approximately two hours ago. I just ordered\n> Hadley Wickham's new book \"R for Data Science\" from Amazon, and it\n> arrived today. It's in there. (A good read, by the way.

Explain briefly.\n \nSolution\n\n\nLet's go through our output from (<a href=\"#part:plot\">here</a>). In terms of\n`age`, when infection is present, animals are (slightly)\nolder. So there might be a small age effect. Next, when infection\nis present, weight is typically a *lot* less. So there ought\nto be a big weight effect. \nFinally, from the table, females are\nsomewhere around 50-50 infected or not, but very few males are\ninfected. So there ought to be a big `sex` effect as well.\nThis also appears in the grouped bar plot, where the red\n(\"absent\") bar for males is much taller than the blue\n(\"present\") bar, but for females the two bars are almost the\nsame height.\nSo the story is that we would expect a significant effect of\n`sex` and `weight`, and maybe of `age` as well.\n \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(d) Fit a logistic regression predicting `infected` from\nthe other three variables.

Explain briefly.\n \nSolution\n\n\nThis is the same idea as in multiple regression: look at the end\nof the line for each variable to get its individual P-value, and\nif that's not small, you can take that variable out. `age`\nhas a P-value of 0.062, which is (just) larger than 0.05, so we\ncan consider removing this variable. The other two P-values,\n0.00089 and 0.024, are definitely less than 0.05, so those\nvariables should stay.\n\nAlternatively, you can say that the P-value for `age` is\nsmall enough to be interesting, and therefore that `age`\nshould stay. That's fine, but then you need to be consistent in\nthe next part.\n\nYou probably noted that `sex` is categorical. However, it\nhas only the obvious two levels, and such a categorical variable\ncan be assessed for significance this way.

The theory doesn't quite apply the same in generalized\nlinear models (of which logistic regression is one): if you had an\ninfinite sample size, the ways would all be identical, but in practice\nyou'll have a very finite amount of data, so they won't agree.\n\nI'm thinking about my aims here: I want to decide whether each\n$x$-variable should stay in the model, and for that I want a test that\nexpresses whether the model fits significantly worse if I take it\nout. The result I get ought to be the same as physically removing it\nand comparing the models with `anova`, \neg. for `age`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninfect.1b <- update(infect.1, . ~ . - age)\nanova(infect.1b, infect.1, test = \"Chisq\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nAnalysis of Deviance Table\n\nModel 1: factor(infected) ~ weight + sex\nModel 2: factor(infected) ~ age + weight + sex\n  Resid.

Explain briefly.\n \nSolution\n\n\nI think they are extremely consistent. When we looked at the\nplots, we said that `weight` and `sex` had large\neffects, and they came out definitely significant. There was a\nsmall difference in age between the infected and non-infected\ngroups, and `age` came out borderline significant (with a\nP-value definitely larger than for the other variables, so that\nthe evidence of its usefulness was weaker).\n\n$\\blacksquare$ \n\n(g) <a name=\"part:crossing\">*</a>\nThe first and third quartiles of `age` are 26 and 130;\nthe first and third quartiles of `weight` are 9 and 16. Obtain predicted probabilities for all combinations of these and\n`sex`. (You'll need to start by making a new data frame, using\n`datagrid` to get all the combinations.)\n \nSolution\n\n Here's how `datagrid`\ngoes. Note my use of plural names to denote\nthe things I want all combinations of:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nages <- c(26, 130)\nweights <- c(9, 16)\nsexes <- c(\"female\", \"male\")\nnew <- datagrid(model = infect.1, age = ages, weight = weights, sex = sexes)\nnew\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  age weight    sex rowid\n1  26      9 female     1\n2  26      9   male     2\n3  26     16 female     3\n4  26     16   male     4\n5 130      9 female     5\n6 130      9   male     6\n7 130     16 female     7\n8 130     16   male     8\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThis is about on the upper end of what you would want to do just using the one line with `datagrid` in it and putting the actual values in instead of `ages`, `weights` etc. To my mind, once it gets longer than about this long, doing on one line starts to get unwieldy. But your taste might be different than mine.\n     \nAside:\n\nI could have asked you to include some more values of `age` and\n`weight`, for example the median as well, to get a clearer\npicture. But that would have made `infect.new` bigger, so I\nstopped here. (If we had been happy with *five* representative values of `age` and `weight`, we could have done `predictions` (below) with `variables` and not had to make `new` at all.)\n\n`datagrid` *makes* a data frame from input vectors, so it\ndoesn't matter if those are different lengths.  In fact, it's also\npossible to make this data frame from things like quartiles stored in\na data frame. To do that, you wrap the whole `datagrid` in a `with`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nd <- tibble(age = ages, weight = weights, sex = sexes)\nd\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 x 3\n    age weight sex   \n  <dbl>  <dbl> <chr> \n1    26      9 female\n2   130     16 male  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnew <- with(d, datagrid(model = infect.1, age=age, weight=weight, sex=sex))\nnew\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  age weight    sex rowid\n1  26      9 female     1\n2  26      9   male     2\n3  26     16 female     3\n4  26     16   male     4\n5 130      9 female     5\n6 130      9   male     6\n7 130     16 female     7\n8 130     16   male     8\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThis one is a little confusing because in eg. `age = age`, the first `age` refers to the column that will be in `new`, and the second one refers to the values that are going in there, namely the column called `age` *in the dataframe d*.^[See, I told you it was a little confusing.] \n\nEnd of aside.\n\nNext, the predictions:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncbind(predictions(infect.1, new))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  rowid   estimate      p.value    s.value    conf.low  conf.high age weight\n1     1 0.24733693 5.820456e-02  4.1027240 0.094114783 0.50966507  26      9\n2     2 0.06560117 5.913303e-04 10.7237481 0.015191414 0.24215462  26      9\n3     3 0.06248811 1.357558e-03  9.5247708 0.012552521 0.25897472  26     16\n4     4 0.01404012 2.655955e-05 15.2004099 0.001955298 0.09379637  26     16\n5     5 0.55058652 7.040885e-01  0.5061713 0.300538624 0.77744105 130      9\n6     6 0.20744380 7.289225e-03  7.1000188 0.089523915 0.41063424 130      9\n7     7 0.19903348 3.378048e-02  4.8876662 0.064286527 0.47334206 130     16\n8     8 0.05041244 1.230894e-05 16.3099339 0.014037457 0.16524755 130     16\n     sex infected\n1 female   absent\n2   male   absent\n3 female   absent\n4   male   absent\n5 female   absent\n6   male   absent\n7 female   absent\n8   male   absent\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nExtra: I didn't ask you to comment on these, since the question is long\nenough already. But that's not going to stop me!\n\nThese, in `predicted`, are predicted probabilities of infection.^[When you have one observation per line, the predictions are of the *second* of the two levels of the response variable. When you make that two-column response, the predictions are of the probability of being in the *first* column. That's what it is. As the young people say, don't @ me.]\n\nThe way I remember the one-column-response thing is that the first\nlevel is the baseline (as it is in a regression with a categorical\nexplanatory variable), and the second level is the one whose\nprobability is modelled (in the same way that the second, third etc.\nlevels of a categorical explanatory variable are the ones that appear\nin the `summary` table).\n\nLet's start with `sex`. The probabilities of a female being\ninfected are all much higher than of a corresponding male (with the\nsame age and weight) being infected. Compare, for example, lines 1 and\n2. Or 3 and 4. Etc. So `sex` has a big effect.\n\nWhat about `weight`? As weight goes from 9 to 16, with\neverything else the same, the predicted probability of infection goes\nsharply *down*. This is what we saw before: precisely, the\nboxplot showed us that infected animals were likely to be less heavy.\n\nLast, `age`. As age goes up, the probabilities go (somewhat) up\nas well. Compare, for example, lines 1 and 5 or lines 4 and 8. I think\nthis is a less dramatic change than for the other variables, but\nthat's a judgement call.\n\nI got this example from (horrible URL warning) here: [link](https://www.amazon.ca/Statistics-Introduction-Michael-J-Crawley/dp/0470022973/ref=pd_sbs_14_3?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0470022973&pd_rd_r=97f19951-0ca9-11e9-9275-b3e00a75f9be&pd_rd_w=EfpAv&pd_rd_wg=2NMH8&pf_rd_p=d4c8ffae-b082-4374-b96d-0608daba52bb&pf_rd_r=HAKACF78DSNTGFPDW3YV&psc=1&refRID=HAKACF78DSNTGFPDW3YV)\nIt starts on page 275 in my edition. He goes at the analysis\na different way, but he finishes with \nanother issue that I want to show you. \n\nLet's work out the residuals and plot them against our quantitative\nexplanatory variables. I think the best way to do this is\n`augment` from `broom`, to create a data frame\ncontaining the residuals alongside the original data:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(broom)\ninfect.1a <- infect.1 %>% augment(infect)\ninfect.1a %>% as_tibble()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 81 x 10\n   infected   age weight sex    .fitted .resid   .hat .sigma  .cooksd .std.resid\n   <chr>    <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>    <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>    <dbl>      <dbl>\n 1 absent       2      1 female   0.407 -1.35  0.140   0.872 0.0710       -1.46 \n 2 absent       9     13 female  -2.24  -0.450 0.0544  0.886 0.00162      -0.463\n 3 present     15      2 female   0.343  1.04  0.116   0.878 0.0263        1.10 \n 4 absent      15     16 female  -2.85  -0.336 0.0416  0.887 0.000657     -0.343\n 5 absent      18      2 female   0.381 -1.34  0.112   0.872 0.0521       -1.43 \n 6 absent      20      9 female  -1.19  -0.729 0.0678  0.883 0.00594      -0.755\n 7 absent      26     13 female  -2.02  -0.498 0.0515  0.886 0.00189      -0.511\n 8 present     42      6 female  -0.227  1.28  0.0664  0.874 0.0239        1.32 \n 9 absent      51      9 female  -0.797 -0.863 0.0515  0.882 0.00645      -0.886\n10 present     52      6 female  -0.100  1.22  0.0609  0.876 0.0191        1.26 \n# i 71 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(infect.1a, aes(x = weight, y = .resid)) + geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/parasite-18-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\n`infect.1a` is, I think, a genuine `data.frame` rather\nthan a `tibble`.\n\nI don't quite know what to make of that plot.

(Though the residuals from a logistic regression can\nbe kind of odd, because the response variable can only be 1 or 0.)\nCrawley tries adding squared terms to the logistic regression, which\ngoes like this. The `glm` statement is long, as they usually\nare, so it's much easier to use `update`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninfect.2 <- update(infect.1, . ~ . + I(age^2) + I(weight^2))\n```\n:::\n\n \n\nAs we saw before, when thinking about what to keep, we want to look at `drop1`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndrop1(infect.2, test = \"Chisq\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nSingle term deletions\n\nModel:\nfactor(infected) ~ age + weight + sex + I(age^2) + I(weight^2)\n            Df Deviance    AIC    LRT Pr(>Chi)   \n<none>           48.620 60.620                   \nage          1   57.631 67.631 9.0102 0.002685 **\nweight       1   50.443 60.443 1.8222 0.177054   \nsex          1   51.298 61.298 2.6771 0.101800   \nI(age^2)     1   55.274 65.274 6.6534 0.009896 **\nI(weight^2)  1   53.091 63.091 4.4710 0.034474 * \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nThe squared terms are both significant. The linear terms,\n`age` and `weight`, have to stay, regardless of their\nsignificance.^[When you have higher-order terms, you have to keep the lower-order ones as well: higher powers, or interactions (as we see in ANOVA later).]\nWhat do the squared terms do to the predictions? Before, there was a\nclear one-directional trend in the relationships with `age` and\n`weight`. Has that changed? Let's see. We'll need a few more\nages and weights to investigate with. I think the set of five representative values that comes out of `predictions` with `variables` would be ideal (and saves us having to make another `new`). \n\nLet's start by assessing the effect of age:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(infect)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   infected              age             weight          sex           \n Length:81          Min.   :  1.00   Min.   : 1.00   Length:81         \n Class :character   1st Qu.: 26.00   1st Qu.: 9.00   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Median : 87.00   Median :13.00   Mode  :character  \n                    Mean   : 83.65   Mean   :11.49                     \n                    3rd Qu.:130.00   3rd Qu.:16.00                     \n                    Max.   :206.00   Max.   :18.00                     \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnew <- datagrid(model = infect.2, age = c(1, 26, 84, 130, 206))\nnew\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    weight  sex age rowid\n1 11.49383 male   1     1\n2 11.49383 male  26     2\n3 11.49383 male  84     3\n4 11.49383 male 130     4\n5 11.49383 male 206     5\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncbind(predictions(infect.2, newdata = new)) %>% \n  select(estimate, age, weight, sex)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     estimate age   weight  sex\n1 0.007131192   1 11.49383 male\n2 0.041754400  26 11.49383 male\n3 0.293063840  84 11.49383 male\n4 0.266655966 130 11.49383 male\n5 0.007067575 206 11.49383 male\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThe actual values of age we chose are as shown.

The students were told that the surgery consisted of\nimplanting a device called a cannula in each cat's brain, through\nwhich chemicals were introduced into the brain and the cats were then\ngiven psychological tests. At the end of the study, the cats' brains\nwere subjected to histological analysis. The complaint asked that the\nresearcher's authorization to carry out the study should be withdrawn,\nand the cats should be handed over to the animal rights group that\nfiled the complaint. It was suggested that the research could just as\nwell be done with computer simulations.\n\nAll of the psychology students in the survey were told all of this. In\naddition, they read a statement by the researcher that no animal felt\nmuch pain at any time, and that computer simulation was *not* an\nadequate substitute for animal research. Each student was also given\n*one* of the following scenarios that explained the benefit of\nthe research:\n\n\n\n* \"cosmetic\": testing the toxicity of chemicals to be used in\nnew lines of hair care products.\n\n* \"theory\": evaluating two competing theories about the function\nof a particular nucleus in the brain.\n\n* \"meat\": testing a synthetic growth hormone said to potentially\nincrease meat production.\n\n* \"veterinary\": attempting to find a cure for a brain disease\nthat is killing domesticated cats and endangered species of wild cats.\n\n* \"medical\": evaluating a potential cure for a debilitating\ndisease that afflicts many young adult humans.\n\n\nFinally, each student completed two questionnaires: one that would assess their\n\"relativism\": whether or not they believe in universal moral\nprinciples (low score) or whether they believed that the appropriate\naction depends on the person and situation (high score). The second\nquestionnaire assessed \"idealism\": a high score reflects a belief\nthat ethical behaviour will always lead to good consequences (and thus\nthat  if a behaviour leads to any bad consequences at all, it is\nunethical).^[I get confused about the difference between morals  and ethics. [This is a very short description of that difference:] (http://smallbusiness.chron.com/differences-between-ethical-issues-moral-issues-business-48134.html). The basic idea is that morals are part of who you are, derived from religion, philosophy etc. Ethics are how you act in a particular situation: that is, your morals, what you believe, inform your ethics, what you do. That's why the students had to play the role of an  ethics committee, rather than a morals committee; presumably the researcher had good morals, but an ethics committee had to evaluate what he was planning to do, rather than his character as a person.]\n\nAfter being exposed to all of that, each student stated their decision\nabout whether the research should continue or stop.\n\nI should perhaps stress at this point that no actual cats were harmed\nin the collection of these data (which can be found as a `.csv`\nfile at\n[link](https://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/decision.csv). The\nvariables in the data set are these:\n\n\n\n* `decision`: whether the research should continue or stop (response)\n\n* `idealism`: score on idealism questionnaire\n\n* `relativism`: score on relativism questionnaire\n\n* `gender` of student\n\n* `scenario` of research benefits that the student read.\n\n\nA more detailed discussion^[If you can believe it.] of this\nstudy is at\n[link](http://core.ecu.edu/psyc/wuenschk/MV/Multreg/Logistic-SPSS.PDF). \n\n\n(a) Read in the data and check by looking at the structure of\nyour data frame that you have something sensible. *Do not* call\nyour data frame `decision`, since that's the name of one of\nthe variables in it.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nSo, like this, using the name `decide` in my case:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_url <- \"https://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/decision.csv\"\ndecide <- read_csv(my_url)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 315 Columns: 5\n-- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): decision, gender, scenario\ndbl (2): idealism, relativism\n\ni Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\ni Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndecide\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 315 x 5\n   decision idealism relativism gender scenario\n   <chr>       <dbl>      <dbl> <chr>  <chr>   \n 1 stop          8.2        5.1 Female cosmetic\n 2 continue      6.8        5.3 Male   cosmetic\n 3 continue      8.2        6   Female cosmetic\n 4 stop          7.4        6.2 Female cosmetic\n 5 continue      1.7        3.1 Female cosmetic\n 6 continue      5.6        7.7 Male   cosmetic\n 7 stop          7.2        6.7 Female cosmetic\n 8 stop          7.8        4   Male   cosmetic\n 9 stop          7.8        4.7 Female cosmetic\n10 stop          8          7.6 Female cosmetic\n# i 305 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n       \n\nThe variables are all the right things and of the right types: the\ndecision, gender and the scenario are all text (representing\ncategorical variables), and idealism and relativism, which were scores\non a test, are quantitative (numerical).

Also, the P-value in `summary`\nis so small that it is likely to be still significant in\n`drop1` as well.\n    \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(c) To investigate the effect (or non-effect) of\n`gender`, create a contingency table by feeding\n`decision` and `gender` into `table`. What does\nthis tell you?\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwith(decide, table(decision, gender))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n          gender\ndecision   Female Male\n  continue     60   68\n  stop        140   47\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n       \n\nFemales are more likely to say that the study should stop (a clear\nmajority), while males are more evenly split, with a small majority in\nfavour of the study continuing.\n\nIf you want the column percents as well, you can use\n`prop.table`. Two steps: save the table from above into a\nvariable, then feed *that* into `prop.table`, calling for\ncolumn percentages rather than row percentages:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntab <- with(decide, table(decision, gender))\nprop.table(tab, 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n          gender\ndecision      Female      Male\n  continue 0.3000000 0.5913043\n  stop     0.7000000 0.4086957\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nWhy column percentages? Well, thinking back to STAB22 or some such\nplace, when one of your variables is acting like a response or outcome\n(`decision` here), make the percentages out of the *other*\none. Given that a student is a female, how likely are they to call for\nthe research to stop? The other way around makes less sense: given\nthat a person wanted the research to stop, how likely are they to be\nfemale? \n\nAbout 70\\% of females and 40\\% of males want the research to\nstop. That's a giant-sized difference. No wonder it was significant.\n\nThe other way of making the table is to use `xtabs`, with the\nsame result:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxtabs(~ decision + gender, data = decide)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n          gender\ndecision   Female Male\n  continue     60   68\n  stop        140   47\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nIn this one, the frequency variable goes on the left side of the\nsquiggle. We don't have one here (each row of the data frame\nrepresents one student), so we leave the left side blank. I tried\nputting a `.` there, but that doesn't work since there is no\n\"whatever was there before\" as there is, for example, in\n`update`. \n\nAs you'll see later on with log-linear models, I now prefer making graphs with these. This is a grouped bar chart that we learned early in STAC32:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(decide, aes(x = gender, fill = decision)) + geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-20-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\nI used `position = \"fill\"` because I wanted to compare *proportions*. This scales each bar to have height 1, no matter how many people it's based on. As a result, you see that if you look at females, most of them think the research as described should stop, and a small majority of the males think it should continue. This is why we have a gender effect.\n    \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(d) <a name=\"part:whichprob\">*</a> Is your slope for `gender` in the previous logistic\nregression positive or negative? Is it applying to males or to females?\nLooking at the conclusions from your \ncontingency table, what probability does that mean your logistic\nregression is actually modelling?\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nMy slope is $-1.2167$, negative, and it is attached to males (note\nthat the slope is called `gendermale`: because \"female\"\nis before \"male\" alphabetically, females are used as the\nbaseline and this slope says how males compare to them). \nThis negative male coefficient means that the probability of\nwhatever is being modelled is *less* for males than it is for\nfemales. Looking at the contingency table for the last part, the\nprobability of \"stop\" should be less for males, so the logistic\nregression is actually modelling the probability of\n\"stop\". Another way to reason that this must be the right answer\nis that the two values of `decision` are `continue`\nand `stop`; `continue` is first alphabetically, so\nit's the baseline, and the *other* one, `stop`, is the\none whose probability is being modelled.\nThat's why I made you do that contingency table. Another way to\nthink about\nthis is to do a prediction, which would go like this:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnew <- datagrid(model = decide.1, gender = levels(factor(decide$gender)))\nnew\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  gender rowid\n1 Female     1\n2   Male     2\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncbind(predictions(decide.1, newdata = new))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  rowid  estimate      p.value  s.value  conf.low conf.high gender decision\n1     1 0.7000000 3.993920e-08 24.57762 0.6329443 0.7594610 Female     stop\n2     2 0.4086957 5.151405e-02  4.27889 0.3227535 0.5006066   Male     stop\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTechnical note: we could simply supply the two genders in the definition of `new`, remembering to type the Capital Letters. The other way is to find out which genders there are in the data, and one way is to temporarily turn `gender` into a `factor` and then find out which different values it has, which are called \"levels\".\n\nThe probability of whatever-it-is is exactly 70\\% for females and\nabout 40\\% for males. A quick look at the contingency table shows\nthat exactly 70\\% ($140/200$) of the females think the research should\nstop, and a bit less than 50\\% of the males think the same thing. So\nthe model is predicting the probability of \"stop\".\n\nThere's a logic to this: it's not just this way \"because it is\". \nIt's the same idea of the first category, now of the response\nfactor, being a \"baseline\", and what actually gets modelled is the\n*second* category, relative to the baseline.\n  \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(e) Add the two variables `idealism` and\n`relativism` to your logistic regression. Do either or both of them add\nsignificantly to your model? Explain briefly.\n\n \nSolution\n\n\nThe obvious way of doing this is to type out the entire model,\nwith the two new variables on the end.

Do each of these increase or decrease\nthat probability? Explain briefly.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nLook back at the summary for the model that I called\n`decide.3`. (Or `decide.2`: the slope coefficients\nare very similar.) The one for `idealism` is positive, so\nthat a higher idealism score goes with a greater likelihood of\nsaying that the research should stop. The slope coefficient for\n`relativity` is negative, so it's the other way around: a\nhigher relativity score goes with a *lower* chance of saying\nthat the research should stop.\n\nThat's all I needed, but as an extra, we can look back at the\ndescription of these scales in the question.\n\nThe `relativism` one was that a person believed that the\nmost moral action depends on the situation (as opposed to a person\nhaving something like religious faith that asserts universal moral\nprinciples that are always true. That would be a low score on the\nrelativism scale). Somebody with a low score on this scale might\nbelieve something like \n\"it is always wrong to experiment on animals\", whereas somebody with a high relativism score  might\nsay that it was sometimes justified. Thus, other things being\nequal, a low relativism score would go with \"stop\" and a high\nrelativism score would (or  might) go with \"continue\". This\nwould mean a *negative* slope coefficient for\n`relativism`, which is what we observed. (Are you still\nwith me? There was some careful thinking there.)\n\nWhat about `idealism`? This is a belief that ethical behaviour\nwill always lead to good consequences, and thus, if the\nconsequences are bad, the behaviour must not have been ethical. A\nperson who scores high on idealism is likely to look at the\nconsequences (experimentation on animals), see that as a bad\nthing, and thus conclude that the research should be stopped. The\n`idealism` slope coefficient, by that argument, should be\npositive, and is.\n\n\nThis can also be done by a prediction. In the light of what we have done before, the suggestion\nis this.

I think this\nis important because in your future work you are likely to spend a lot\nof your time getting data from how you receive it to something\nsuitable for analysis.\n\nThese data came from a psychology study (with, probably, the students\nin a class serving as experimental subjects).

Normally a data frame read into R has a much\nsimpler structure than this, but this is R trying to interpret how\nSPSS does things. Here, each column (listed on the lines beginning\nwith a dollar sign) has some values, listed after `num`; they\nare all numeric, even the categorical ones. What happened to the\ncategorical variables is that they got turned into numbers, and they\nhave a `names` \"attribute\" further down that says what those\nnumbers actually represent.\nThus, on\nthe `gender` line, the subjects are a female (0), then a male\n(1), then three females, then a male, and so on. Variables like\n`gender` are thus so far neither really factors nor text\nvariables, and so we'll have to do a bit of processing before we can\nuse them: we want to replace the numerical values by the appropriate\n\"level\".\n\nTo turn a numeric variable into text depending on the value, we can\nuse `ifelse`, but this gets unwieldy if there are more than two\nvalues to translate.

In a study, a large\nnumber of variables were measured, as follows:\n\n\n\n* `age` (years)\n\n* `sex` male or female\n\n* `pain.type` Chest pain type (4 values: typical angina,\natypical angina, non-anginal pain, asymptomatic)\n\n* `resting.bp` Resting blood pressure, on admission to hospital\n\n* `serum.chol` Serum cholesterol\n\n* `high.blood.sugar`: greater than 120, yes or no\n\n* `electro` resting electrocardiographic results (normal,\nhaving ST-T, hypertrophy)\n\n* `max.hr` Maximum heart rate\n\n* `angina` Exercise induced angina (yes or no)\n\n* `oldpeak` ST depression induced by exercise relative to\nrest. See [link](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ecg-library/st-segment/).\n\n* `slope` Slope of peak exercise ST segment. Sloping up,\nflat or sloping down\n\n* `colored` number of major vessels (0--3) coloured by fluoroscopy\n\n* `thal` normal, fixed defect, reversible defect\n\n* `heart.disease` yes, no (response)\n\n\nI don't know what most of those are, but we will not let that stand in\nour way. Our aim is to find out what variables are associated with\nheart disease, and what values of those variables give high\nprobabilities of heart disease being present.

The response variable is a factor, so the first level\nis the baseline and the *second* level is the one\npredicted. R puts factor levels alphabetically, so `no` is\nfirst and `yes` is second. That is, a logistic regression\nwill predict the probability that a person *does* have heart disease.\nI want to see that logic (which is why I said \"convincingly\"):\none observation per line, and therefore that the second level of\nthe factor is predicted, which is `yes`. \n    \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(c) <a name=\"part:heart-first\">*</a> Fit a logistic regression predicting heart disease from\neverything else (if you have a column called `X` or\n`X1`, ignore that), and display the results.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nA lot of typing, since there are so many variables.

When you have a factor in a model, there\nis a slope for each level except for the first, which is a baseline\n(and its slope is taken to be zero). That would be\n`asymptomatic` for `pain.type`. The $t$-tests for the\nother levels of `pain.type` say whether that level of pain\ntype differs significantly (in terms of probability of heart disease)\nfrom the baseline level. Here, pain type `atypical` is not\nsignificantly different from the baseline, but the other two pain\ntypes, `nonanginal` and `typical`, *are*\nsignificantly different. If you think about this from an ANOVA-like\npoint of view, the question about `pain.type`'s significance is\nreally \"is there at least one of the pain types that is different from the others\", and if we're thinking about whether we should keep\n`pain.type` in the logistic regression, this is the kind of\nquestion we should be thinking about. \n    \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(d) Quite a lot of our explanatory variables are factors. To\nassess whether the factor as a whole should stay or can be removed,\nlooking at the slopes won't help us very much (since they tell us\nwhether the other levels of the factor differ from the baseline,\nwhich may not be a sensible comparison to make). To assess which\nvariables are candidates to be removed, factors included (properly),\nwe can use `drop1`.

These two P-values are almost the same as the ones\non `summary`, because they are a two-level factor and a numeric\nvariable respectively, and so the tests are equivalent in the two\ncases. (The P-values are not identical because the tests on\n`summary` and `drop1` are the kind of thing that would\nbe identical on a regular regression but are only \"asymptotically the same\" \nin logistic regression, so you'd expect them to be close\nwithout being the same, as here. \"Asymptotically the same\" means\nthat if you had an infinitely large sample size, they'd be identical,\nbut our sample size of 200-odd individuals is not infinitely large!\nAnyway, the largest P-value on the `summary` is 0.9965, which\ngoes with `electroSTT`. `electro`, though, is a factor\nwith three levels; this P-value says that `STT` is almost\nidentical (in its effects on heart disease) with the baseline\n`hypertrophy`. But there is a third level, `normal`,\nwhich is a bit different from `hypertrophy`. So the factor\n`electro` overall has some effect on heart disease, which is\nreflected in the `drop1` P-value of 0.12: this might go later,\nbut it has to stay for now because at least one of its levels is\ndifferent from the others in its effect on heart disease.

Create and save\na data frame that contains predictions for all combinations of representative\nvalues for all the variables in the model that came out of\n`step`. By \"representative\" I mean all the values for a\ncategorical variable, and the five-number summary for a numeric\nvariable. (Note that you will get a *lot* of predictions.)\n\n\nSolution\n\nThe hard work is in listing all the variables. The easiest way to make sure you have them all is to look at the `summary` of your best model (mine was called `heart.3`) first, and copy them from the `Call` at the top. This is easier than looking at the table of Coefficients (or `tidy` output) because for categorical variables like `pain.type` you will have to distinguish the name of the variable from its levels. For example, the table of Coefficients has `pain.typeatypical` and `pain.typenonanginal`. Is it obvious to you where the variable name ends and its level begins?^[If it is for you, go right ahead, but for me it wasn't.]\n\nAll right, let's set up our dataframe to predict from. This needs the five-number summary of quantitative variables (via `quantile`), and the levels of the categorical ones (via `levels(factor())`).

That is to say, it's being male that\nmakes the difference, not the fact that any of the other\nvariables are different for males.\n\nIt's rather difficult to scan 108,000 predictions to see the effect of being male, but we can do this:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnew <- datagrid(model = heart.3, sex = levels(factor(heart$sex)))\ncbind(predictions(heart.3, newdata = new))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  rowid  estimate     p.value  s.value   conf.low conf.high    pain.type\n1     1 0.1813080 0.005938807 7.395611 0.07033929 0.3932832 asymptomatic\n2     2 0.5849307 0.453873232 1.139639 0.36478323 0.7756961 asymptomatic\n  resting.bp serum.chol   max.hr oldpeak     slope   colored   thal    sex\n1   131.3444   249.6593 149.6778    1.05 upsloping 0.6703704 normal female\n2   131.3444   249.6593 149.6778    1.05 upsloping 0.6703704 normal   male\n  heart.disease\n1           yes\n2           yes\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat this does is to choose a single representative value for all the other variables: the mean for a quantitative variable like resting blood pressure, and the most common category for a categorical variable like `pain.type`. If you scan all the way along the two rows, you find that the values for all the variables are the same except for `sex` at the end. The predicted probabilities of heart disease are very different for males and females (much higher for males), especially given that all else really is equal.\n\nTo see this graphically, we can use `plot_predictions`, and we can include another variable such as resting blood pressure. It's better to list the quantitative one first:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_predictions(heart.3, condition = c(\"resting.bp\", \"sex\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-34-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\nAs the resting blood pressure increases, the probability of heart disease increases, but the blue line for males is well above the red one for females all the way across. For example, for a 50% chance of heart disease, this will happen for males with a resting blood pressure of about 120, but for females not until the resting blood pressure reaches 190!\n\nPerhaps, therefore, the easiest way to avoid a heart attack is to not be male!\n        \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  Successful breastfeeding\n\n\n A regular pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, and a\nbaby that is born at or before 33 weeks is called\n\"premature\". The number of weeks at which a baby is born is called\nits \"gestational age\". \nPremature babies are usually smaller than normal and\nmay require special care. It is a good sign if, when the mother and\nbaby leave the hospital to go home, the baby is successfully breastfeeding.\n\nThe data in\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/breastfeed.csv) are from\na study of 64 premature infants. There are three columns: the\ngestational age (a whole number of weeks), the number of babies of\nthat gestational age that were successfully breastfeeding when they\nleft the hospital, and the number that were not. (There were multiple\nbabies of the same gestational age, so the 64 babies are summarized in\n6 rows of data.)\n\n\n\n(a) Read the data into R and display the data frame.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nNo great challenge here, I hope:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_url <- \"http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/breastfeed.csv\"\nbreastfeed <- read_csv(my_url)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 6 Columns: 3\n-- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (3): gest.age, bf.yes, bf.no\n\ni Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\ni Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbreastfeed\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 x 3\n  gest.age bf.yes bf.no\n     <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>\n1       28      2     4\n2       29      2     3\n3       30      7     2\n4       31      7     2\n5       32     16     4\n6       33     14     1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n     \n\nThat looks reasonable.\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n\n(b) Verify that there were indeed 64 infants, by having R do a\nsuitable calculation on your data frame that gives the right answer\nfor the right reason.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nThe second and third columns are all frequencies, so it's a\nquestion of adding them up. For example:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbreastfeed %>% summarize(total = sum(bf.yes) + sum(bf.no))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 x 1\n  total\n  <dbl>\n1    64\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nor if you want to go nuts (this one pivot-longers all the frequencies\ntogether into one column and then adds them up):\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbreastfeed %>%\n  pivot_longer(bf.yes:bf.no, names_to=\"yesno\", values_to=\"freq\") %>%\n  summarize(total = sum(freq))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 x 1\n  total\n  <dbl>\n1    64\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nFind a way to get it done. If it works and it does the right thing,\nit's good. \n\nDo *not* copy the numbers out of your data frame, type them in\nagain and use R to add them up. Do something with your data frame as\nyou read it in.\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(c) Do you think, looking at the data, that there is a\nrelationship between gestational age and whether or not the baby was\nsuccessfully breastfeeding when it left the hospital? Explain briefly.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nThe babies with the youngest gestational age (the most premature)\nwere mostly *not* breastfeeding when they left the\nhospital. Most of the 30- and 31-week babies were breastfeeding,\nand almost all of the 32- and 33-week babies were\nbreastfeeding. So I think there will be a relationship: as\ngestational age increases, the probability that the baby will be\nbreastfeeding will also increase. (This, looking ahead, suggests a\npositive slope in a logistic regression.)\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(d) Why is logistic regression a sensible technique to use\nhere? Explain briefly.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nThe response variable is a yes/no: whether or not an infant is\nbreastfeeding. We want to predict the probability of the response\nbeing in one or the other category. This is what logistic\nregression does. (The explanatory variable(s) are usually\nnumerical, as here, but they could be factors as well, or a\nmixture. The key is the kind of response. The number of babies\nthat are successfully breastfeeding at a certain gestational age\nis modelled as binomial with $n$ being the total number of babies\nof that gestational age, and $p$ being something that might\ndepend, and here *does* depend, on gestational age.)\n    \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(e) Fit a logistic regression to predict the probability that\nan infant will be breastfeeding from its gestational age. Show the\noutput from your logistic regression.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nThese are summarized data, rather than one infant per line, so\nwhat we have to do is to make a two-column response \"matrix\",\nsuccesses in the first column and failures in the second, and then\npredict *that* from gestational age. The currently-approved method is `cbind` inside `glm`, since this makes the use of `marginaleffects` easier later:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbreastfeed.1 <- glm(cbind(bf.yes, bf.no) ~ gest.age, data = breastfeed, family = \"binomial\")\nsummary(breastfeed.1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = cbind(bf.yes, bf.no) ~ gest.age, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = breastfeed)\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Explain briefly.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nThe slope *is* significant (P-value 0.0035 is much less than\n0.05). We said above that we expected there to be a relationship\nbetween gestational age and whether or not the baby was\nbreastfeeding, and this significant slope is confirming that there\n*is* a relationship. So this is exactly what we expected to\nsee, and not a surprise at all.\nIf you concluded above that you did *not* see a relationship,\nyou should colour yourself surprised here. Consistency.\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(g) Is your slope (in the `Estimate` column) positive or\nnegative? What does that mean, in terms of gestational ages and\nbreastfeeding? Explain briefly.\n \n\nSolution\n\n\nMy slope is 0.5769, positive. That means that as the explanatory\nvariable, gestational age, increases, the probability of the event\n(that the baby is breastfeeding) also increases.\nThis is also what I observed above: almost all of the near-term\n(large gestational age) babies were breastfeeding, whereas a fair\nfew of the small-gestational-age (very premature) ones were not. \n\nWe know that the event is \"is breastfeeding\" rather than \"is not\", because the first column of our response matrix is \"yes\" rather than \"no\".\n\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(h) Obtain the predicted probabilities that an infant will\nsuccessfully breastfeed for a representative collection of gestational ages.\n\nSolution\n\n\nPick some gestational ages, like the median and quartiles, or just pick some values like 25, 30, 35.^[I realize I am extrapolating with these values.] 40 weeks is a full-term baby (that's how long a \"normal\" pregnancy lasts):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnew <- datagrid(model = breastfeed.1, gest.age = c(25, 30, 35))\ncbind(predictions(breastfeed.1, newdata = new)) %>% \n  select(gest.age, estimate)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  gest.age   estimate\n1       25 0.09134905\n2       30 0.64272897\n3       35 0.96987261\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n(i) Make a graph of the predicted probability that an infant will successfully breastfeed as it depends on gestational age.\n\nWe did the `cbind` inside `glm` thing, which means that we can use `plot_predictions` as normal.

I first created some new variables:\n`total` is the total number of babies of each gestational age, and\n`proportion` is the observed proportion of breastfeeding babies at\neach gestational age (number of yes divided by total).\n\nThen I add this to the plot of predicted probabilities.\n(as points). To do *that*, I need to change which dataframe I am using (the temporary one called `d` with the proportions and totals in it), and the variables I am plotting (which are now the ones in `d`).\nThe way I\ndo that is to put an `aes` inside the `geom_line` to\nsay \"use this `x` and `y` instead\". I also\nwanted to draw attention to the gestational ages where more babies\nwere observed; I did this by making the *size* of the plotted\npoints proportional to how many babies there were at that gestational\nage (which was the quantity `total` I calculated above).  \nThe legend for `total` tells you what size point\ncorresponds to how many total babies. \n\nThe idea is that the observed and predicted should be reasonably\nclose, or at least not grossly different, especially when there is a lot of data (the circles are large), and I think they *are*\nclose, which indicates that our model is doing a good job. You can see that there is not much data on the left, with small gestational ages, so the confidence interval around the predictions is wider there. On the right, where there is more data, the interval is narrower. When the gestational age is large (the baby is closer to being full term rather than premature), there is a good chance that the baby will be able to breastfeed, and we are fairly sure about that. (Very premature babies, with a gestational age under 30 weeks, are rare, which is a good thing because those babies tend  to have other health problems as well.)\n    \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  Making it over the mountains\n\n\n In 1846, the Donner party (Donner and Reed\nfamilies) left Springfield, Illinois for California in covered\nwagons. After reaching Fort Bridger, Wyoming, the leaders decided to\nfind a new route to Sacramento. They became stranded in the eastern\nSierra Nevada mountains at a place now called Donner Pass, when the\nregion was hit by heavy snows in late October. By the time the\nsurvivors were rescued on April 21, 1847, 40 out of 87 had died.\n\nAfter the rescue, the age and gender of each person in the party was\nrecorded, along with whether they survived or not. The data are in\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/donner.txt). \n\n\n\n(a) Read in the data and display its structure.

You can see that the data format used on\nthat website is not as nice as ours. (I did some work to make it look\nnicer for you, with proper named categories rather than 0 and 1.)\n    \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(b) Make graphical or numerical summaries for each pair of\nvariables. That is, you should make a graph or numerical summary for\neach of \n`age` vs. `gender`, `age` vs.\\\n`survived` and `gender` vs. `survived`. In choosing the\nkind of graph or summary that you will use, bear in mind that\n`survived` and `gender` are factors with two\nlevels. \n\n\nSolution\n\n\nThinking about graphs first: we have two numeric-vs-factor graphs\n(the ones involving `age`), which I think should be\nboxplots, though they could be something like side-by-side\nhistograms (if you are willing to grapple with\n`facet_grid`). The other two variables are both\nfactors, so a good graph for them would be something\nlike a grouped bar plot (as in the question about parasites earlier).\nIf you prefer numerical summaries: you could do mean age (or some\nother summary of age) for each group defined by gender or\nsurvivorship, and you could do a cross-tabulation of frequencies\nfor gender and survival. I'll take any mixture of graphs and\nnumerical summaries that addresses each pair of variables somehow\nand summarizes them in a sensible way.\nStarting with `age` vs. `gender`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(donner, aes(x = gender, y = age)) + geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/donner-2-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n     \n\nor:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(donner, aes(x = age)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10) + facet_grid(gender ~ .)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/donner-3-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nor:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndonner %>% group_by(gender) %>% summarize(m = mean(age))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 x 2\n  gender     m\n  <chr>  <dbl>\n1 female  31.1\n2 male    32.2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nAge vs. `survived` is the same idea:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(donner, aes(x = survived, y = age)) + geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/donner-5-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n     \n\nor:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(donner, aes(x = age)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10) + facet_grid(survived ~ .)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/donner-6-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nor:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndonner %>% group_by(survived) %>% summarize(m = mean(age))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 x 2\n  survived     m\n  <chr>    <dbl>\n1 no        35.5\n2 yes       27.2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nFor `survived` against `gender`, the obvious thing is a\ncross-tabulation, gotten like this:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwith(donner, table(gender, survived))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n        survived\ngender   no yes\n  female  5  10\n  male   20  10\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nor like this:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndonner %>% group_by(gender, survived) %>% summarize(n = n())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'gender'.

Explain briefly.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nI think the graphs are the easiest thing to interpret, but use\nwhatever you got:\n\n\n* The females on average were younger than the males. (This\nwas still true with the medians, even though those very old\nmales might have pulled the mean up.)\n\n* The people who survived were on average younger than those\nwho didn't (or, the older people tended not to survive).\n\n* A greater proportion of females survived than males.\n\nA relevant point about each relationship is good.\n    \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(d) Fit a logistic regression predicting survival from age and\ngender. Display the summary.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nEach row of the data frame is one person, so we can use the\n`survived` column without going through that two-column\nresponse business.\nHowever, the response variable `survived` is a categorical\nvariable expressed as text, so we need to make it into a\n`factor` first. Either create a new variable that is the\nfactor version of `survived`, or do it right in the `glm`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndonner.1 <- glm(factor(survived) ~ age + gender, family = \"binomial\", data = donner)\nsummary(donner.1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = factor(survived) ~ age + gender, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = donner)\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Explain briefly.\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nBoth explanatory variables have a P-value (just) less than 0.05, so\nthey both have an impact on survival: taking either one of them out\nof the logistic regression would be a mistake.\nTo see if this makes sense, go back to your plots or summaries, the\nones involving survival. For age, the mean or median age of the\nsurvivors was less than for the people who died, by five year\n(median) or eight years (mean), so it makes sense that there would\nbe an age effect. For gender, two-thirds of the women survived and\ntwo-thirds of the men died, so there ought to be a gender effect and is.\n  \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(f) Are the men typically older, younger or about the same age as\nthe women? Considering this, explain carefully what the negative\n`gendermale` slope in your logistic regression means.\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nThe men are typically older than the women. \nThe negative (and significant) `gendermale` slope means that\nthe probability of a male surviving is less than that of a woman\n*of the same age*. Or, though the males are typically\nolder, *even after you allow for that*, the males have worse\nsurvival. (`genderfemale` is the baseline.)\nYou need to get at the idea of \"all else equal\" when you're\nassessing regression slopes of any kind: regular regression,\nlogistic regression or survival analysis (coming up later). That's\nwhy I said \"carefully\" in the question. If I say \"carefully\" or\n\"precisely\", a complete answer is looking for a specific thing to\nshow that you understand the issue completely.\n  \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(g) Obtain predicted probabilities\nof survival for each combination of some representative ages and of the two genders in this dataset.\n\nSolution\n\nMake a dataframe containing some ages (you pick them) and the two genders, in combination, using `datagrid`:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(donner)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      age          gender            survived        \n Min.   :15.0   Length:45          Length:45         \n 1st Qu.:24.0   Class :character   Class :character  \n Median :28.0   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :31.8                                        \n 3rd Qu.:40.0                                        \n Max.   :65.0                                        \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnew <- datagrid(model = donner.1, age = c(15, 25, 30, 40, 65), gender = c(\"female\", \"male\"))\nnew\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   age gender rowid\n1   15 female     1\n2   15   male     2\n3   25 female     3\n4   25   male     4\n5   30 female     5\n6   30   male     6\n7   40 female     7\n8   40   male     8\n9   65 female     9\n10  65   male    10\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncbind(predictions(donner.1, newdata = new))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   rowid   estimate    p.value   s.value    conf.low conf.high age gender\n1      1 0.88668846 0.02435792 5.3594655 0.566195671 0.9791302  15 female\n2      2 0.61302822 0.46194876 1.1141953 0.317415946 0.8436698  15   male\n3      3 0.78165072 0.05922165 4.0777315 0.487594533 0.9308781  25 female\n4      4 0.42019292 0.44498485 1.1681719 0.240816991 0.6234558  25   male\n5      5 0.70771076 0.14721981 2.7639563 0.422753155 0.8889504  30 female\n6      6 0.32893588 0.08854661 3.4974191 0.177477408 0.5268564  30   male\n7      7 0.52554048 0.87331289 0.1954295 0.239648864 0.7956146  40 female\n8      8 0.18316607 0.01514943 6.0445931 0.062884867 0.4283504  40   male\n9      9 0.13553852 0.15833274 2.6589684 0.011807792 0.6729187  65 female\n10    10 0.03076455 0.01739012 5.8455881 0.001845139 0.3527587  65   male\n   survived\n1        no\n2        no\n3        no\n4        no\n5        no\n6        no\n7        no\n8        no\n9        no\n10       no\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n(There are five ages chosen, something like a five-number summary, and two genders here, so ten predictions.)\n\nThese, remember, are predicted probabilities of *surviving*. \n\n  \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(h) Do your predictions support your conclusions from earlier\nabout the effects of age and gender? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nWe said before that the probability of survival was lower if the age\nwas higher. This is confirmed here: for example, look at the odd-numbered rows 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, which are all females of increasing ages; the probability of\nsurvival decreases. (Or look at males, in the even-numbered rows; the\neffect is the same.)\n\nTo see the effect of gender, look at two predictions of different\ngenders but the same age (eg. rows 1 and 2). The female is always\npredicted to have the higher survival probability. This is also what\nwe saw before. The effect of gender is substantial, but not strongly\nsignificant, because we only have 45 observations, not so many when\nall we know about each person is whether they survived or not.\nI wanted you to think about these different ways to understand the\nmodel, and to understand that they all say the same thing, in\ndifferent ways (and thus you can look at whichever of them is most\nconvenient or comprehensible). For the logistic and survival models,\nI find looking at predictions to be the easiest way to understand\nwhat the model is saying.\n  \n$\\blacksquare$\n\n\n\n\n\n##  Who needs the most intensive care?\n\n\n The \"APACHE II\" is a scale for assessing patients who\narrive in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital. These are seriously\nill patients who may die despite the ICU's best attempts. APACHE\nstands for \"Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation\".^[As with many of these acronyms, you get the idea that the acronym came first and they devised some words to fit it.]\nThe scale score is calculated from several physiological measurements\nsuch as body temperature, heart rate and the Glasgow coma scale, as\nwell as the patient's age. The final result is a score between 0 and\n71, with a higher score indicating more severe health issues. Is it\ntrue that a patient with a higher APACHE II score has a higher\nprobability of dying?\n\nData from one hospital are in\n[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/apache.txt). The columns\nare: the APACHE II score, the total number of patients who had that\nscore, and the number of patients with that score who died.\n\n\n\n(a) Read in and display the data (however much of it\ndisplays). Why are you convinced that have the right thing?\n\nSolution\n\n\nData values separated by one space, so:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_url <- \"http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/apache.txt\"\nicu <- read_delim(my_url, \" \")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 38 Columns: 3\n-- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------\nDelimiter: \" \"\ndbl (3): apache, patients, deaths\n\ni Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\ni Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nicu\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 38 x 3\n   apache patients deaths\n    <dbl>    <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1      0        1      0\n 2      2        1      0\n 3      3        4      1\n 4      4       11      0\n 5      5        9      3\n 6      6       14      3\n 7      7       12      4\n 8      8       22      5\n 9      9       33      3\n10     10       19      6\n# i 28 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n     \n\nI had to stop and think about what to call the data frame, since one\nof the columns is called `apache`.\n\nAnyway, I appear to have an `apache` score between 0 and something, a\nnumber of patients and a number of deaths (that is no bigger than the\nnumber of patients). If you check the original data, the `apache`\nscores go up to 41 and are all the values except for a few near the\nend, so it makes perfect sense that there would be 38 rows.\n\nBasically, any comment here is good, as long as you make one and it\nhas something to do with the data.\n\n`apache` scores could be as high as 71, but I imagine a patient would\nhave to be *very* ill to get a score anywhere near that high.\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(b) Does each row of the data frame relate to one patient or\nsometimes to more than one? Explain briefly.\n\nSolution\n\n\nSometimes to more than one. The number in the `patients`\ncolumn says how many patients that line refers to: that is to say\n(for example) the row where `apache` equals 6 represents\n*all* the patients whose `apache` score was 6, however many\nof them there were (14 in this case).\nI had to be careful with the wording because the first two rows of\nthe data frame actually *do* refer to only one patient each\n(who survived in both cases), but the later rows do refer to more\nthan one patient.\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(c) Explain why this is the kind of situation where you need a\ntwo-column response.\n\nSolution\n\n\nThis needs a two-column response precisely *because* each row\nrepresents (or could represent) more than one observation.\nThe two columns are the number of observations referring to the\nevent of interest (dying), and the number of observations where\nthat didn't happen (survived). \n\nThat's as far as you need to go.\n\n\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(d) Fit a logistic regression to estimate the probability of\ndeath from the `apache` score, and display the results.\n\nSolution\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\napache.1 <- glm(cbind(deaths, patients - deaths) ~ apache, family = \"binomial\", data = icu)\nsummary(apache.1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = cbind(deaths, patients - deaths) ~ apache, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = icu)\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Explain briefly.\n\nSolution\n\n\nA gimme two points. The P-value for `apache` is $4.94\n\\times 10^{-13}$, very small, so `apache` score definitely\nhas an effect on the probability of survival.\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(f) Is the effect of a larger `apache` score to increase or to\ndecrease the probability of death? Explain briefly.\n\nSolution\n\n\nThe slope coefficient for `apache` is 0.1156, positive, and\nsince we are modelling the probability of death (the first column\nof the response matrix), this says that as `apache` goes\nup, the probability of death goes up as well.\nIf you made your response matrix with the columns the other way\naround, the slope coefficient for `apache` should be\n$-0.1156$, but the explanation should come to the same place,\nbecause this says that the probability of survival goes down as\n`apache` goes up.\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(g) Obtain the predicted probability of death for a representative collection of the\n`apache` scores that were in the data set. Do your predictions behave as you would expect (from your earlier work)?\n\nSolution\n\n\"Representative\" is a clue that you can choose more or less what values you like. The median and quartiles, or the five-number summary, or something near those, are reasonable choices:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(icu)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     apache         patients         deaths      \n Min.   : 0.00   Min.   : 1.00   Min.   : 0.000  \n 1st Qu.:10.25   1st Qu.: 3.00   1st Qu.: 1.000  \n Median :19.50   Median :11.50   Median : 4.000  \n Mean   :19.55   Mean   :11.95   Mean   : 4.605  \n 3rd Qu.:28.75   3rd Qu.:17.75   3rd Qu.: 7.000  \n Max.   :41.00   Max.   :33.00   Max.   :13.000  \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnew <- datagrid(model = apache.1, apache = c(10, 20, 30))\nnew\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    deaths patients apache rowid\n1 4.605263 11.94737     10     1\n2 4.605263 11.94737     20     2\n3 4.605263 11.94737     30     3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncbind(predictions(apache.1, newdata = new)) %>% \n  select(apache, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  apache  estimate  conf.low conf.high\n1     10 0.2434135 0.1960219 0.2980157\n2     20 0.5055540 0.4462302 0.5647219\n3     30 0.7646761 0.6672078 0.8404252\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nDisplay a  reasonably small number of columns.\n\nAs the `apache` score goes up, the predicted probability of death also goes up. This is what we would expect to see given the positive slope on `apache` in the model `apache.1`. (Again, if your model had the columns of the response the other way around, you were predicting the probability of *survival*, and your predictions should then show it going down rather than up to go with the negative slope you would then have had.)\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(h) Make a plot of predicted death probability against\n`apache` score, with, also on the plot, the\nobserved proportion of deaths within each `apache` score,\nplotted against `apache` score. Does there seem to be good\nagreement between observation and prediction? Hint: calculate what you need to from the original dataframe first, save it, then make a plot of the predictions, and then to the plot add the appropriate thing from the dataframe you just saved.\n\nSolution\n\nAll right, following the hint, let's start with the original dataframe, called `icu`. The plot of the predictions is going to show predicted probabilities of death, so from the data we need to find the observed proportions of death at each `apache` score. Our dataframe has one row for each `apache` score, so this is not too hard. We have the total number of patients at each score, and the number of deaths out of those patients, so the proportion that died is the second of those divided by the first one:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nicu %>% mutate(proportion = deaths / patients) -> d\nd\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 38 x 4\n   apache patients deaths proportion\n    <dbl>    <dbl>  <dbl>      <dbl>\n 1      0        1      0     0     \n 2      2        1      0     0     \n 3      3        4      1     0.25  \n 4      4       11      0     0     \n 5      5        9      3     0.333 \n 6      6       14      3     0.214 \n 7      7       12      4     0.333 \n 8      8       22      5     0.227 \n 9      9       33      3     0.0909\n10     10       19      6     0.316 \n# i 28 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nThat looks all right. \n\nTo plot predicted values, `plot_predictions`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_predictions(apache.1, condition = \"apache\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-44-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis again shows that the predicted probability of death goes up sharply with `apache` score. Let's add the data to this graph. The trick is to remember how to add points to a graph you already have, when the points come from a different data set:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_predictions(apache.1, condition = \"apache\") +\n  geom_point(data = d, aes(x = apache, y = proportion))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-45-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\nThat does a reasonably good job, but we can do better. We observe now that most of  the points are reasonably close to the curve, except for that one in the bottom right, a patient who had the highest `apache` score of all, but who happened to survive. The observed proportions that are 1 or 0 over on the right might have been based on only one patient, and the others might have been based on more. So it would be better to encode how many patients each point is based on, for example by the size of the point (you may be able to think of other ways like colour, and you can experiment to see what gets the message across best in your opinion).\n\nAll right, we can make the points different sizes according to the number of `patients` they are based on, thus:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_predictions(apache.1, condition = \"apache\") +\n  geom_point(data = d, aes(x = apache, y = proportion, size = patients))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-46-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\nThis shows clearly that the points on the left and right of the graph are based on very few patients, maybe only one each time. But most of the scores between about 10 and 20 were represented by more patients, maybe up to 30. The bigger circles seem to follow the trend of the predictions pretty well, which is what we were hoping for; the proportions based on small numbers of patients might be further away from the predictions, and that's all right.\n\nExtra: you can see that we want the proportions to be based on reasonable numbers of patients, but the other end of the issue is that we don't want to combine patients with very different `apache` scores, because then you wouldn't get much of a picture of how well the data follow the trend. This is very much the same idea as choosing the number of bins on a histogram; if you have too many bins, each one will contain very few observations and you won't see the pattern very clearly, but if you have too few bins, you'll have lots of observations in each bin but you still won't see the shape. \n\nWith that in mind, perhaps we can try binning the observations in our data here. Let's see what that does. The starting point is to redefine what I called `d` before which had the proportion in it:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbreak_points <- seq(-1, 45, 4)\nbreak_points\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] -1  3  7 11 15 19 23 27 31 35 39 43\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nicu %>% mutate(bins = cut(apache, breaks = break_points))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 38 x 4\n   apache patients deaths bins  \n    <dbl>    <dbl>  <dbl> <fct> \n 1      0        1      0 (-1,3]\n 2      2        1      0 (-1,3]\n 3      3        4      1 (-1,3]\n 4      4       11      0 (3,7] \n 5      5        9      3 (3,7] \n 6      6       14      3 (3,7] \n 7      7       12      4 (3,7] \n 8      8       22      5 (7,11]\n 9      9       33      3 (7,11]\n10     10       19      6 (7,11]\n# i 28 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nMy bins are 4 `apache` points wide. I have no idea yet whether that's any good, but I want to get the procedure down so that I can come back and change that later if I want to.\n\nWhat I am using to make the bins is a base R function called `cut`. This makes categorical bins out of a quantitative variable (which is normally a bad idea, but we have our reasons here). It takes two inputs: a vector of numbers to bin, and the points that divide one bin from the next, which I defined into a vector called `break_points` first. The function `cut` defines bins as \"half-open\", meaning that the top end is included but the bottom end is excluded. (Note for example which bin an `apache` score of 3 goes into.)\n\nNow we want to total up the patients and deaths within each bin, and, for reasons you'll see later, we want to know where the middle of each bin is (for which I will use the median of the `apache` scores within that bin):\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nicu %>% mutate(bins = cut(apache, breaks = break_points)) %>% \n  group_by(bins) %>% \n  summarize(patients = sum(patients), deaths = sum(deaths), apache = median(apache))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 11 x 4\n   bins    patients deaths apache\n   <fct>      <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1 (-1,3]         6      1    2  \n 2 (3,7]         46     10    5.5\n 3 (7,11]       105     19    9.5\n 4 (11,15]       92     32   13.5\n 5 (15,19]       85     36   17.5\n 6 (19,23]       57     34   21.5\n 7 (23,27]       36     23   25.5\n 8 (27,31]       18     12   29.5\n 9 (31,35]        6      6   33.5\n10 (35,39]        2      2   36.5\n11 (39,43]        1      0   41  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nWe have redefined the names: `patients` and `deaths` are now the totals of patients and deaths *within each bin*, and `apache` is now something like the middle `apache` score in each bin.\n\nNow we can work out the proportion of patients that died within each bin, and save that:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nicu %>% mutate(bins = cut(apache, breaks = break_points)) %>% \n  group_by(bins) %>% \n  summarize(patients = sum(patients), deaths = sum(deaths), apache = median(apache)) %>% \n  mutate(proportion = deaths / patients) -> d\nd\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 11 x 5\n   bins    patients deaths apache proportion\n   <fct>      <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>      <dbl>\n 1 (-1,3]         6      1    2        0.167\n 2 (3,7]         46     10    5.5      0.217\n 3 (7,11]       105     19    9.5      0.181\n 4 (11,15]       92     32   13.5      0.348\n 5 (15,19]       85     36   17.5      0.424\n 6 (19,23]       57     34   21.5      0.596\n 7 (23,27]       36     23   25.5      0.639\n 8 (27,31]       18     12   29.5      0.667\n 9 (31,35]        6      6   33.5      1    \n10 (35,39]        2      2   36.5      1    \n11 (39,43]        1      0   41        0    \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nNow we redo our graph, but using the proportions in here as the observed proportions of deaths in the data. You might now realize the reason for those values in the `apache` column: on the graph, the `proportion` values will be our $y$ coordinates, but we needed something to be the $x$ coordinates.\n\nActually redrawing our graph is in fact *exactly* the same code as before; the thing that has changed is our definition of `d` in it:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_predictions(apache.1, condition = \"apache\") +\n  geom_point(data = d, aes(x = apache, y = proportion, size = patients))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-50-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\nAnd now we see, with more patients per bin, that the agreement between data and prediction is very good apart from the very small bins on the right.\n\nOne modification that you might like to pursue is to have variable-width bins: wider bins at the extremes and narrower bins in the middle, so that each bin has about the same number of patients. You could do this by modifying what I called `break_points` so that the numbers in it are more spread out at the extremes and closer together in the middle.\n\nExtra extra: if you're a football fan, you could imagine doing a very similar analysis by modelling the probability of successfully kicking a field goal as it depends on the distance it is attempted from. This would probably work pretty well for the NFL and (no doubt) for the CFL as well. In both these codes of football, field goals are always attempted from between two side-to-side marks on the field called \"hash marks\". In the NFL, the hash marks are close together, so field goals are attempted from more or less directly in front of the goalposts. In the CFL, the hash marks are further apart, so a field goal might be attempted from off to the side of the goalposts, and then the probability of success might also depend on how far off to the side you are.\n\nIf you happen also to be a rugby fan, you'll know that kicks at goal might need to be attempted from anywhere on the field, even out near the sidelines, and in that case, the chance of kicking a goal definitely depends on where on the field you are kicking it from as well as how far out it is.\n\nExtra extra extra: football (NFL and CFL) have an effective formality called the \"point after\": after a team scores a touchdown, the kicker kicks at goal from right in front of the posts, which is almost never missed. In rugby, the equivalent to a touchdown is called a \"try\", and to score a try the player must literally touch the ball down. (Thus, to a rugby fan, the NFL and CFL \"touchdowns\" are absurd misnomers.) After a try is scored, there is a kick at goal (called a \"conversion\") which is not taken from right in front of the posts like in the NFL, but from the side-to-side position on the field where the try was scored. Thus, if a try is scored near the sidelines, as it often is, the conversion has to be kicked from near the sideline as well. The kicker can go as far back down the field as they like, but as you might imagine, a sideline conversion is still very difficult to kick.\n\nExtra-to-the-fourth: the reason for those names in rugby. In the old days, if a team scored a try and kicked the conversion as well, it was called a \"goal\", and as a rugby player, you wanted your team to score a goal. Scoring a try allowed a team to \"try\" to \"convert\" it into a \"goal\" by kicking the conversion, hence the names. Because the NFL and CFL have their roots in rugby, they have the \"point after\" a touchdown as well (with the option now of allowing teams to try for two points after a touchdown as well).\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##  Go away and don't come back!\n\n\n When a person has a heart attack and survives it, the major\nconcern of health professionals is to prevent the person having a\nsecond heart attack.

(This is the common refrain of \"all else equal\".)\n\nPick a level of `anger`, say `n` (it doesn't matter\nwhich) and look at the effect of `anxiety`. The probability\nof a second heart attack increases sharply from 0.17 to 0.40 to\n0.69. So an increased anxiety score is associated with an\nincreased probability of second heart attack (all else equal).\n\nTo assess the effect of taking the anger management course, pick\nan `anxiety` value, say 40, and compare the probabilities\nfor `anger` `n` and `y`. For someone who has\nnot taken the anger management course, the probability is 0.17,\nbut for someone who has, it drops all the way to 0.07. (The\npattern is the same at the other anxiety scores.)\n\nExtra: the reason it doesn't matter what value of the other\nvariable you look at (as long as you keep it fixed) is that the\nmodel is \"additive\" with no interaction, so that the effect of\none variable does not depend on the value of the other one. If we\nwanted to see whether the effect of anxiety was different\naccording to whether or not the person had taken the anger\nmanagement course, we would add an interaction between\n`anxiety` and `anger`. But we won't be doing this\nkind of thing until we get to analysis of variance, so you don't\nneed to worry about it yet.\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n(f) Are the effects you described in the previous part\nconsistent with the `summary` output from `glm` that\nyou obtained in (<a href=\"#part:fit\">here</a>)? Explain briefly how they are, or\nare not. (You need an explanation for each of `anxiety` and\n`anger`, and you will probably get confused if you look at\nthe P-values, so don't.)\n\nSolution\n\n\nIn the previous part, we found that increased anxiety went with an\nincreased probability of second heart attack. Back in\n(<a href=\"#part:fit\">here</a>), we found a positive slope of 0.11904 for anxiety,\nwhich also means that a higher anxiety score goes with a higher\nprobability of second heart attack.\nThat was not too hard. The other one is a little more work.\n`anger` is categorical with two categories `n` and\n`y`. The first one, `n`, is the baseline, so\n`angery` shows how `y` compares to `n`. The\nslope $-1.04211$ is negative, which means that someone who has\ntaken the anger management course has a *lower* probability\nof a second heart attack than someone who hasn't (all else\nequal). This is the same story that we got from the predictions. \nThat's it for that, but I suppose I should talk about those\nP-values. \n`anxiety` is significant, so it definitely has an effect on\nthe probability of a second heart attack. The pattern is clear\nenough even with this small data set. Here's a visual:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(ha, aes(x = second, y = anxiety)) + geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/ha2-7-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n     \n\nThis is the wrong way around in terms of cause and effect, but it\nshows pretty clearly that people who suffer a second heart attack have\na higher level of anxiety than those who don't.\n\nThat's clear enough, but what about `anger`? That is *not*\nsignificant, but there seems to be a visible effect of `anger`\non the predicted probabilities of (<a href=\"#part:preds\">here</a>): there we saw\nthat if you had done the anger management course, your probability of\na second heart attack was lower. But that's only the predicted\nprobability, and there is also uncertainty about that, probably quite\na lot because we don't have much data. So if we were to think about\nconfidence intervals for the predicted probabilities, they would be\nwide, and for the two levels of `anger` at a fixed\n`anxiety` they would almost certainly overlap.\n\nAnother way of seeing that is a visual, which would be a side-by-side\nbar chart:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(ha, aes(x = anger, fill = second)) + geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](logistic-regression_files/figure-pdf/ha2-8-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nA small majority of people who took the anger management did not have\na second heart attack, while a small minority of those who did not,\ndid.^[Read that carefully.] But with these small numbers, the\ndifference, even though it points the way we would have guessed, is\nnot large enough to be significant:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwith(ha, table(anger, second))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     second\nanger n y\n    n 4 7\n    y 6 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n \n\nThis is not nearly far enough from an equal split to be\nsignificant. (It's the same kind of idea as for Mood's median test in\nC32/C33.)\n\n$\\blacksquare$\n\n\n\n",
