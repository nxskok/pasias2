##  Reading files different ways


 This question is about different ways of reading data files. If you're using `r.datatools` (online), start at the beginning and go as far as (d). If you're using R Studio running on your own computer, start at part (<a href="#part:own-start">here</a>). 



(a) Log in to `r.datatools.utoronto.ca`. Open up a project (or start a new
one), and watch the spinning circles for a few minutes. When that's
done, create a new Quarto Document with File, New File, Quarto Document. Delete the "template" document, but keep the top
lines with `title:` 
and possibly `output:` in them. Add a code chunk that contains `library(tidyverse)` and run it.


(b)  <a name="part:internet-file">*</a> The easiest kind of files to read
in are ones on the Internet, with a URL address that begins with
`http` 
or `https`.  I have a small file at
[link](http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/testing.txt). Click
the link to see it, and keep the tab open for the next part of this question.
This is a text file with three things on each
line, each separated by exactly one space. Read the data file into a
data frame, and display your data frame.


(c) You might have data in a file on your own computer. To read
data from such a file, you first have to *upload* it to `r.datatools`, and then read it from there. To practice this: open a
text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit). Go back to the web browser
tab containing the data you used in the previous part. Copy the data
from there and paste it into the text editor. Save it somewhere on
your computer (like the Desktop). Upload that file to `r.datatools`, read in the data and verify that you get the right
thing. (For this last part, see the Solution.)


(d) You might have a spreadsheet on your computer. Create a
`.csv` file from it, and use the ideas of the last part to
read it into R Studio.


(e)  <a name="part:own-start">*</a> Start here if you downloaded R and R
Studio and they are running on your own computer. 
Open a web browser and point it at

(f) You might have data in a file on your own computer. To read data
from such a file, R has to know where to find it. Each R project lives
in a folder, and one way of specifying where a data file is is to give
its complete path relative to the folder that R Studio is running its
current project in. This is rather complicated, so we will try a
simpler way. To set this up, open a text editor (like Notepad or
TextEdit). Go back to the web browser tab containing the data you used
in the previous part. Copy the data from there and paste it into the
text editor. Save it somewhere on your computer (like the
Desktop). Follow the steps in the solution below to read the data 
into R.


(g) You might have a spreadsheet on your computer. Create a
`.csv` file from it, and use the ideas of the last part to
read it into R Studio.
