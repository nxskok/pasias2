    "text": "Introduction\nThis book contains a collection of problems, and my solutions to them, in applied statistics with R. These come from my courses STAC32, STAC33, and STAD29 at the University of Toronto Scarborough.\nYou will occasionally see question parts beginning with a *; this means that other question parts refer back to this one. (One of my favourite question strategies is to ask how two different approaches lead to the same answer, or more generally to demonstrate that there are different ways to see the same thing.)\nThanks to Dann Sioson for spotting some errors and making some useful suggestions.\nIf you see anything, file an issue on the Github page for now. Likely problems include:\nAs I read through looking for problems like these, I realize that there ought to be a textbook that reflects my way of doing things. There isn’t one (yet), though there are lecture notes. Current versions of these are at:\nA little background:\nSTAC32 is an introduction to R as applied to statistical methods that have (mostly) been learned in previous courses. This course is designed for students who have a second non-mathematical applied statistics course such as this. The idea is that students have already seen a little of regression and analysis of variance (and the things that precede them), and need mainly an introduction of how to run them in R.\nSTAC33 is an introduction to R, and applied statistics in general, for students who have a background in mathematical statistics. The way our courses are structured, these students have a strong mathematical background, but not very much experience in applications, which this course is designed to provide. The material covered is similar to STAC32, with a planned addition of some ideas in bootstrap and practical Bayesian statistics. There are some questions on these here.\nSTAD29 is an overview of a number of advanced statistical methods. I start from regression and proceed to some regression-like methods (logistic regression, survival analysis, log-linear frequency table analysis), then I go a little further with analysis of variance and proceed with MANOVA and repeated measures. I finish with a look at classical multivariate methods such as discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, principal components and factor analysis. I cover a number of methods in no great depth; my aim is to convey an understanding of what these methods are for, how to run them and how to interpret the results. Statistics majors and specialists cannot take this course for credit (they have separate courses covering this material with the proper mathematical background). D29 is intended for students in other disciplines who find themselves wanting to learn more statistics; we have an Applied Statistics Minor program for which C32 and D29 are two of the last courses."

Click on the button to the left of “R Studio” (it will show blue), click the orange Log in to Start, and log in using your UTorID and password.\n\nSolution\nThis is about what you should see first, before you click the orange thing:\n\nYou will see a progress bar as things start up, and then you should see something like this:\n\nThis is R Studio, ready to go.\nIf you are already logged in to something else on the same browser that uses your UTorID and password, you may come straight here without needing to log in again.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nTake a look around, and create a new Project. Give the new project any name you like.\n\nSolution\nSelect File and New Project to get this:\n\nClick on New Directory (highlighted blue on mine). This will create a new folder to put your new project in, which is usually what you want to do. The idea is that a project is a container for a larger collection of work, such as all your assignments in this course. That brings you to this:\n\nwhere you click on New Project (highlighted on mine), and:\n\nGive your project a name, as I did. Then click Create Project. At this point, R Studio will be restarted in your new project. You can tell which project you are in by looking top right, and you’ll see the name of your project next to the R symbol:\n\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nOne last piece of testing: find the Console window (which is probably on the left). Click next to the blue >, and type library(tidyverse). Press Enter.\n\nSolution\nIt may think a bit, and then you’ll see something like this:\n\nAside: I used to use a cloud R Studio called rstudio.cloud. If you see or hear any references to that, it means the same thing as R Studio on r.datatools or jupyter. (You can still use rstudio.cloud if you want; it used to be completely free, but now the free tier won’t last you very long; the utoronto.calink is free as long as you are at U of T.) I’m trying to get rid of references to R Studio Cloud as I see them, but I am bound to miss some, and in the lecture videos they are rather hard to find.\nNow we can get down to some actual work.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)"

    "section": "1.3 Getting started",
    "text": "1.3 Getting started\nThis question is to get you started using R.\n\nStart R Studio on r.datatools (or on your computer), in some project. (If you started up a new project in the previous question and are still logged in, use that; if not, create a new project with File, New Project, and New Directory. Then select New Project and give it a name. Click Create Project. This will give you an empty workspace to start from.)\n\nSolution\nYou ought to see something like this:\n\nThere should be one thing on the left half, and at the top right it’ll say “Environment is empty”.\nExtra: if you want to tweak things, select Tools (at the top of the screen) and from it Global Options, then click Appearance. You can make the text bigger or smaller via Editor Font Size, and choose a different colour scheme by picking one of the Editor Themes (which previews on the right). My favourite is Tomorrow Night Blue. Click Apply or OK when you have found something you like. (I spend a lot of time in R Studio, and I like having a dark background to be easier on my eyes.)\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nWe’re going to do some stuff in R here, just to get used to it. First, make a Quarto document by selecting File, New File and Quarto Document.\n\nSolution\nIn the first box that pops up, you’ll be invited to give your document a title. Make something up for now.\nThe first time, you might be invited to “install some packages” to make the document thing work.1 Let it do that by clicking Yes. After that, you’ll have this:\n\nA couple of technical notes:\n\nthis should be in the top left pane of your R Studio now, with the Console below it.\nAt the top of the file, between the two lines with three hyphens (minus signs, whatever), is some information about the document, known in the jargon as a YAML block, any of which you can change:\n\nthe title is whatever title you gave your document\nthe formatis what the output is going to be (in this case, HTML like a webpage, which is mostly what we’ll be using)\nthere is a visual editor that looks like Notion or a bit like a Google doc (the default), and also a Source editor which gives you more control, and shows that underlying the document is a thing called R Markdown (which is a code for writing documents).\n\nMy document is called “My awesome title”, but the file in which the document lives is still untitled because I haven’t saved it yet. See right at the top.\n\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nYou can delete the template code below the YAML block now (that is, everything from the title “Quarto” to the end). Somewhere in the space opened up below the YAML block (it might say “Heading 2”, greyed out), type a /. This, like Notion, gives you a list of things to choose from to insert there. Pressing Enter will insert a “code chunk”, sometimes known as a “code cell”. We are going to use this in a moment.\n\nSolution\nSomething like this:\n\nThe {r} at the top of the code chunk means that the code that will go in there will be R code (you can also have a Python code chunk, among others).\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nOn the line below the {r}, type these two lines of code into the chunk in the Quarto document:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmtcars\nSolution\nWhat this will do: get hold of a built-in data set with information about some different models of car, and display it.\n\nIn approximately five seconds, you’ll be demonstrating that for yourself.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nRun this command. To do that, look at the top right of your code chunk block (shaded in a slightly different colour). You should see a down arrow and a green “play button”. Click the play button. This will run the code, and show the output below the code chunk.\n\nSolution\nHere’s what I get (yours should be the same):\n\nThis is a rectangular array of rows and columns, with individuals (here, cars) in rows and variables in columns, known as a “dataframe”. When you display a dataframe in an Quarto document, you see 10 rows and as many columns as will fit on the screen. At the bottom, it says how many rows and columns there are altogether (here 32 rows and 11 columns), and which ones are being displayed.\nYou can see more rows by clicking on Next, and if there are more columns, you’ll see a little arrow next to the rightmost column (as here next to am) that you can click on to see more columns. Try it and see. Or if you want to go to a particular collection of rows, click one of the numbers between Previous and Next: 1 is rows 1–10, 2 is rows 11–20, and so on.\nThe column on the left without a header (containing the names of the cars) is called “row names”. These have a funny kind of status, kind of a column and kind of not a column; usually, if we need to use the names, we have to put them in a column first.\nIn future solutions, rather than showing you a screenshot, expect me to show you something like this:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmtcars\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe top bit is the code, the bottom bit the output. In this kind of display, you only see the first ten rows (by default).2\nIf you don’t see the “play button”, make sure that what you have really is a code chunk. (I often accidentally delete one of the special characters above or below the code chunk). If you can’t figure it out, delete this code chunk and make a new one. Sometimes R Studio gets confused.\nOn the code chunk, the other symbols are the settings for this chunk (you have the choice to display or not display the code or the output or to not actually run the code). The second one, the down arrow, runs all the chunks prior to this one (but not this one).\nYour output has its own little buttons (as seen on the screenshot). The first one pops the output out into its own window; the second one shows or hides the output, and the third one deletes the output (so that you have to run the chunk again to get it back). Experiment. You can’t do much damage here.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nSomething a little more interesting: summary obtains a summary of whatever you feed it (the five-number summary plus the mean for numerical variables). Obtain this for our data frame. To do this, create a new code chunk below the previous one, type summary(mtcars) into the code chunk, and run it.\n\nSolution\nThis is what you should see:\n\nor the other way:\n\nsummary(mtcars)\n\n      mpg             cyl             disp             hp       \n Min.   :10.40   Min.   :4.000   Min.   : 71.1   Min.   : 52.0  \n 1st Qu.:15.43   1st Qu.:4.000   1st Qu.:120.8   1st Qu.: 96.5  \n Median :19.20   Median :6.000   Median :196.3   Median :123.0  \n Mean   :20.09   Mean   :6.188   Mean   :230.7   Mean   :146.7  \n 3rd Qu.:22.80   3rd Qu.:8.000   3rd Qu.:326.0   3rd Qu.:180.0  \n Max.   :33.90   Max.   :8.000   Max.   :472.0   Max.   :335.0  \n      drat             wt             qsec             vs        \n Min.   :2.760   Min.   :1.513   Min.   :14.50   Min.   :0.0000  \n 1st Qu.:3.080   1st Qu.:2.581   1st Qu.:16.89   1st Qu.:0.0000  \n Median :3.695   Median :3.325   Median :17.71   Median :0.0000  \n Mean   :3.597   Mean   :3.217   Mean   :17.85   Mean   :0.4375  \n 3rd Qu.:3.920   3rd Qu.:3.610   3rd Qu.:18.90   3rd Qu.:1.0000  \n Max.   :4.930   Max.   :5.424   Max.   :22.90   Max.   :1.0000  \n       am              gear            carb      \n Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :3.000   Min.   :1.000  \n 1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:3.000   1st Qu.:2.000  \n Median :0.0000   Median :4.000   Median :2.000  \n Mean   :0.4062   Mean   :3.688   Mean   :2.812  \n 3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:4.000   3rd Qu.:4.000  \n Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :5.000   Max.   :8.000  \n\n\nFor the gas mileage column mpg, the mean is bigger than the median, and the largest value is unusually large compared with the others, suggesting a distribution that is skewed to the right.\nThere are 11 numeric (quantitative) variables, so we get the five-number summary plus mean for each one. Categorical variables, if we had any here, would be displayed a different way.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nLet’s make a histogram of the gas mileage data. Type the code below into another new code chunk, and run it:\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) + geom_histogram(bins = 8)\nThe code looks a bit wordy, but we’ll see what all those pieces do later in the course (like, maybe tomorrow).\nSolution\nThis is what you should see:\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) + geom_histogram(bins = 8)\n\n\n\n\nThe long right tail supports our guess from before that the distribution is right-skewed.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nSome aesthetics: Add some narrative text above and below your code chunks. Above the code chunk is where you say what you are going to do (and maybe why you are doing it), and below is where you say what you conclude from the output you just obtained. I find it looks better if you have a blank line above and below each code chunk.\n\nSolution\nThis is what I wrote (screenshot), with none of the code run yet. My library(tidyverse) line seems to have disappeared, but yours should still be there:\n\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nSave your Quarto document (the usual way with File and Save). This saves it on the jupyter servers (and not on your computer). This means that when you come back to it later, even from another device, this document will still be available to you. (If you are running R Studio on your own computer, it is much simpler: the Quarto document is on that computer, in the folder associated with the project you created.)\n\nNow click Render. This produces a pretty HTML version of your Quarto document. This will appear in a new tab of your web browser, which you might need to encourage to appear (if you have a pop-up blocker) by clicking a Try Again.\nSolution\nIf there are any errors in the rendering process, these will appear in the Render tab. The error message will tell you where in your document your error was. Find it and correct it.3 Otherwise, you should see your document.\nExtra 1: the rendering process as you did it doesn’t produce that nice display of a dataframe that I had in one of my screenshots. To get that, alter the YAML block to read:\nformat: \n  html:\n     df-print: paged\nThis way, anyone reading your document can actually page through the dataframes you display in the same way that you did, to check that they contain the right things.\nExtra 2: you might prefer to have a preview of your document within R Studio. To make this happen, look for the gear wheel to the right of Render. Click the arrow beside it, and in the drop-down, click on Preview in Viewer Pane. Render again, and you’ll see the rendered version of your document in a Viewer pane on the right. This puts the thing you’re writing and what it will look like side by side.\nExtra 3: you might be annoyed at having to remember to save things. If you are, you can enable auto-saving. To do this, go to Tools and select Global Options. Select Code (on the left) and Saving (at the top). Click on Automatically Save when editor loses focus, to put a check mark in the box on the left of it. Change the pull-down below that to Save and Write Changes. Click OK. Now, as soon as you pause for a couple of seconds, everything unsaved will be saved.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nPractice handing in your rendered Quarto document, as if it were an assignment that was worth something. (It is good to get the practice in a low-stakes situation, so that you’ll know what to do next week.)\n\nSolution\nThere are two steps: download the HTML file onto your computer, and then handing it in on Quercus. To download: find the HTML file that you want to download in the Files pane on the right. You might need to click on Files at the top, especially if you had a Viewer open there before:\n\nI called my Quarto document awesomeand the file I was working on was called awesome.qmd(which stands for “Quarto Markdown”). That’s the file I had to render to produce the output. My output file itself is called awesome.html.That’s the file I want to hand in. If you called your file something different when you saved it, that’s the thing to look for: there should be something ending in .qmd and something with the same first part ending in .html.\nClick the checkbox to the left of the HTML file. Now click on More above the bottom-right pane. This pops up a menu from which you choose Export. This will pop up another window called Export Files, where you put the name that the file will have on your computer. (I usually leave the name the same.) Click Download. The file will go to your Downloads folder, or wherever things you download off the web go.\nNow, to hand it in. Open up Quercus at q.utoronto.ca, log in and navigate to this course. Click Assignments. Click (the title of) Assignment 0. There is a big blue Start Assignment button top right. Click it. You’ll get a File Upload at the bottom of the screen. Click Choose File and find the HTML file that you downloaded. Click Open (or equivalent on your system). The name of the file should appear next to Choose File. Click Submit Assignment. You’ll see Submitted at the top right, and below that is a Submission Details window and the file you uploaded.\n\nYou should be in the habit of always checking what you hand in, by downloading it again and looking at it to make sure it’s what you thought you had handed in.\nIf you want to try this again, you can try again as many times as you like, by making a New Attempt. (For the real thing, you can use this if you realize you made a mistake in something you submitted. The graders’ instructions, for the real thing, are to grade the last file submitted, so in that case you need to make sure that the last thing submitted before the due date includes everything that you want graded. Here, though, it doesn’t matter.)\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nOptional extra. Something more ambitious: make a scatterplot of gas mileage mpg, on the \\(y\\) axis, against horsepower, hp, on the \\(x\\)-axis.\n\nSolution\nThat goes like this. I’ll explain the steps below.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg)) + geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nThis shows a somewhat downward trend, which is what you’d expect, since a larger hp value means a more powerful engine, which will probably consume more gas and get fewer miles per gallon. As for the code: to make a ggplot plot, as we will shortly see in class, you first need a ggplot statement that says what to plot. The first thing in a ggplot is a data frame (mtcars here), and then the aes says that the plot will have hp on the \\(x\\)-axis and mpg on the \\(y\\)-axis, taken from the data frame that you specified. That’s all of the what-to-plot. The last thing is how to plot it; geom_point() says to plot the data values as points.\nYou might like to add a regression line to the plot. That is a matter of adding this to the end of the plotting command:\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nThe line definitely goes downhill. Decide for yourself how well you think a line fits these data.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)"

    "text": "1.4 Reading data from a file\nIn this question, we read a file from the web and do some descriptive statistics and a graph. This is very like what you will be doing on future assignments, so it’s good to practice it now.\nTake a look at the data file at http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/jumping.txt. These are measurements on 30 rats that were randomly made to do different amounts of jumping by group (we’ll see the details later in the course). The control group did no jumping, and the other groups did “low jumping” and “high jumping”. The first column says which jumping group each rat was in, and the second is the rat’s bone density (the experimenters’ supposition was that more jumping should go with higher bone density).\n\nWhat are the two columns of data separated by? (The fancy word is “delimited”).\n\nSolution\nExactly one space. This is true all the way down, as you can check.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nMake a new Quarto document. Leave the YAML block, but get rid of the rest of the template document. Start with a code chunk containing library(tidyverse). Run it.\n\nSolution\nYou will get either the same message as before or nothing. (I got nothing because I had already loaded the tidyverse in this session.)\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nPut the URL of the data file in a variable called my_url. Then use read_delim to read in the file. (See solutions for how.) read_delim reads data files where the data values are always separated by the same single character, here a space. Save the data frame in a variable rats.\n\nSolution\nLike this:\n\nmy_url <- \"http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/jumping.txt\"\nrats <- read_delim(my_url,\" \")\n\nRows: 30 Columns: 2\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \" \"\nchr (1): group\ndbl (1): density\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nThe second thing in read_delim is the thing that separates the data values. Often when you use read_delim it’ll be a space.\nHint: to get the file name into my_url, the best way is to right-click on the link, and select Copy Link Address (or equivalent in your browser). That puts in on your clipboard. Then make a code chunk and put this in it (you’ll probably only need to type one quote symbol, because R Studio will supply the other one):\n\nmy_url <- \"\"\n\nthen put the cursor between the two quote symbols and paste. This is better than selecting the URL in my text and then copy-pasting that because odd things happen if it happens to span two lines on your screen. (URLs tend to be rather long, so this is not impossible.)\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nTake a look at your data frame, by making a new code chunk and putting the data frame’s name in it (as we did with mtcars).\n\nSolution\n\nrats\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThere are 30 rows and two columns, as there should be.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nFind the mean bone density for rats that did each amount of jumping.\n\nSolution\nThis is something you’ll see a lot: group_by followed by summarize. Reminder: to get that funny thing with the percent signs (called the “pipe symbol”), type control-shift-M (or equivalent on a Mac):\n\nrats %>% group_by(group) %>%\nsummarize(m = mean(density))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe mean bone density is clearly highest for the high jumping group, and not much different between the low-jumping and control groups.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nMake a boxplot of bone density for each jumping group.\n\nSolution\nOn a boxplot, the groups go across and the values go up and down, so the right syntax is this:\n\nggplot(rats, aes(x=group, y=density)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\nGiven the amount of variability, the control and low-jump groups are very similar (with the control group having a couple of outliers), but the high-jump group seems to have a consistently higher bone density than the others.\nThis is more or less in line with what the experimenters were guessing, but it seems that it has to be high jumping to make a difference.\nYou might recognize that this is the kind of data where we would use analysis of variance, which we will do later on in the course: we are comparing several (here three) groups.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)"

    "section": "1.5 Reading files different ways",
    "text": "1.5 Reading files different ways\nThis question is about different ways of reading data files. If you’re working online (using r.datatools or similar), start at the beginning. If you’re using R Studio running on your own computer, start at part (here).\n\nLog in to r.datatools.utoronto.ca. Open up a project (or start a new one), and watch the spinning circles for a few minutes. When that’s done, create a new Quarto Document with File, New File, Quarto Document. Delete the “template” document, but not the top lines with title: and output: in them. Add a code chunk that contains library(tidyverse) and run it.\n\nSolution\nSo far you (with luck) have something that looks like this:\n\nIf you have an error rather than that output, you probably need to install the tidyverse first. Make another code chunk, containing\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nand run it. Wait for it to finish. It may take a while. If it completes successfully (you might see the word DONE at the end), delete that code chunk (you don’t need it any more) and try again with the library(tidyverse) chunk. It should run properly this time.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n* The easiest kind of files to read in are ones on the Internet, with a URL address that begins with http or https. I have a small file at link. Click the link to see it, and keep the tab open for the next part of this question. This is a text file with three things on each line, each separated by exactly one space. Read the data file into a data frame, and display your data frame.\n\nSolution\nData values separated by exactly one space is the kind of thing that read_delim reads, so make another code chunk and fill it with this:\n\nmy_url <- \"http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/testing.txt\"\ntesting <- read_delim(my_url, \" \")\n\nRows: 6 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \" \"\nchr (1): g\ndbl (2): x, y\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\ntesting\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWhen you run that, you’ll see something like my output. The first part is read_delim telling you what it saw in the file: two columns of (whole) numbers and one column of text. The top line of the file is assumed to contain names, which are used as the names of the columns of your data frame. The bottom part of the output, obtained by putting the name of the data frame on a line by itself in your code chunk, is what the data frame actually looks like. You ought to get into the habit of eyeballing it and checking that it looks like the values in the data file.\nThe things on the left side of the <- symbol (that is meant to look like an arrow pointing left) are variables that you are creating in R. You get to choose the names for them. My habit is to use my_url for URLs of files that I am going to read in, and (usually) to give my data frames names that say something about what they contain, but this is your choice to make.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nYou might have data in a file on your own computer. To read data from such a file, you first have to upload it to r.datatools, and then read it from there. To practice this: open a text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit). Go back to the web browser tab containing the data you used in the previous part. Copy the data from there and paste it into the text editor. Save it somewhere on your computer (like the Desktop). Upload that file, read in the data and verify that you get the right thing. (For this last part, see the Solution.)\n\nSolution\nI copied and pasted the data, and saved it in a file called testing.txt on my computer. I’m assuming that you’ve given it a similar name. Then go back to r.datatools. You should have a Files pane bottom right. If you don’t see a pane bottom right at all, press Control-Shift-0 to show all the panes. If you see something bottom right but it’s not Files (for example a plot), click the Files tab, and you should see a list of things that look like files, like this:\n\nClick the Upload button (next to New Folder), click Choose File. Use the file finder to track down the file you saved on your computer, then click OK. The file should be uploaded to the same folder on r.datatools that your project is, and appear in the Files pane bottom right. To read it in, you supply the file name to read_delim thus: ::: {.cell}\ntesting2 <- read_delim(\"testing.txt\", \" \")\n\nRows: 6 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \" \"\nchr (1): g\ndbl (2): x, y\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n:::\nand then you look at it in the same way as before:\n\ntesting2\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCheck.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nYou might have a spreadsheet on your computer. Create a .csv file from it, and use the ideas of the last part to read it into R Studio.\n\nSolution\nOpen the spreadsheet containing the data you want to read into R. If there are several sheets in the workbook, make sure you’re looking at the right one. Select File, Save As, select “CSV” or “comma-separated values” and give it a name. Save the resulting file somewhere.\nThen follow the same steps as the previous part to upload it to your project on R Studio Cloud. (If you look at the actual file, it will be plain text with the data values having commas between them, as the name suggests. You can open the file in R Studio by clicking on it in the Files pane; it should open top left.)\nThe final step is to read it into an R data frame. This uses read_csv; there are several read_ functions that read in different types of file, and you need to use an appropriate one.\nMy spreadsheet got saved as cars.csv, so:\n\ncars <- read_csv(\"cars.csv\")\n\nRows: 38 Columns: 6\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (2): Car, Country\ndbl (4): MPG, Weight, Cylinders, Horsepower\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\ncars\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSome information about different types of cars.\nYou are now done with this question.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\n* Start here if you downloaded R and R Studio and they are running on your own computer. Open a web browser and point it at link. Click the link to see it, and keep the tab open for the next part of this question. This is a text file with three things on each line, each separated by exactly one space. Read the data file into a data frame, and display your data frame.\n\nSolution\nData values separated by exactly one space is the kind of thing that read_delim reads, so make another code chunk and fill it with this: ::: {.cell}\nmy_url <- \"http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/testing.txt\"\ntesting <- read_delim(my_url, \" \")\n\nRows: 6 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \" \"\nchr (1): g\ndbl (2): x, y\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\ntesting\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n:::\nWhen you run that, you’ll see something like my output. The first part is read_delim telling you what it saw in the file: two columns of (whole) numbers and one column of text.

You get to choose the names for them. My habit is to use my_url for URLs of files that I am going to read in, and (usually) to give my data frames names that say something about what they contain, but this is your choice to make.\n(This part is exactly the same whether you are running R Studio on r.datatools or have R Studio running on your computer. A remote file is obtained in exactly the same way regardless.)\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nYou might have data in a file on your own computer. To read data from such a file, R has to know where to find it. Each R project lives in a folder, and one way of specifying where a data file is is to give its complete path relative to the folder that R Studio is running its current project in. This is rather complicated, so we will try a simpler way. To set this up, open a text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit). Go back to the web browser tab containing the data you used in the previous part. Copy the data from there and paste it into the text editor. Save it somewhere on your computer (like the Desktop). Follow the steps in the solution below to read the data into R.\n\nSolution\nI copied and pasted the data, and saved it in a file called testing.txt on my computer. I’m assuming that you’ve given it a similar name. Go back to R Studio. Create a new code chunk containing this: ::: {.cell}\nf <- file.choose()\n:::\nRun this code chunk. You’ll see a file chooser. Find the file you saved on your computer, and click Open (or OK or whatever you see). This saves what R needs to access the file in the variable f. If you want to, you can look at it:\n\nf\n\nand you’ll see what looks like a file path in the appropriate format for your system (Windows, Mac, Linux). To read the data in, you supply the file path to read_delim thus: ::: {.cell}\ntesting2 <- read_delim(f, \" \")\n:::\nand then you look at it in the same way as before:\n\ntesting2\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCheck.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nYou might have a spreadsheet on your computer.

Save the resulting file somewhere.\nThen read it into an R data frame. This uses read_csv; there are several read_ functions that read in different types of file, and you need to use an appropriate one. Before that, though, again run\n\nf <- file.choose()\n\nto find the .csv file on your computer, and then\n\ncars <- read_csv(f)\n\nto read it in. My spreadsheet was\n\ncars\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSome information about different types of cars.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)"

You can click on that link just above to open the file.\n\nThe data values are separated by a space. Use the appropriate Tidyverse function to read the data directly from the course website into a “tibble”.\n\nSolution\nStart with this (almost always):\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nThe appropriate function, the data values being separated by a space, will be read_delim. Put the URL as the first thing in read_delim, or (better) define it into a variable first:1\n\nurl <- \"http://ritsokiguess.site/datafiles/ojuice.txt\"\njuice <- read_delim(url, \" \")\n\nRows: 24 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \" \"\ndbl (3): run, sweetness, pectin\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nread_delim (or read_csv or any of the others) tell you what variables were read in, and also tell you about any “parsing errors” where it couldn’t work out what was what. Here, we have three variables, which is entirely consistent with the three columns of data values in the file.\nread_delim can handle data values separated by any character, not just spaces, but the separating character, known as a “delimiter”, does not have a default, so you have to say what it is, every time.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nTake a look at what got read in. Do you have data for all 24 runs?\n\nSolution\nType the name of the data frame in a code chunk (a new one, or add it to the end of the previous one). Because this is actually a “tibble”, which is what read_delim reads in, you’ll only actually see the first 10 lines, but it will tell you how many lines there are altogether, and you can click on the appropriate thing to see the rest of it.\n\njuice\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nI appear to have all the data. If you want further convincing, click Next a couple of times to be sure that the runs go down to number 24.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nIn your data frame, where did the column (variable) names come from? How did R know where to get them from?\n\nSolution\nThey came from the top line of the data file, so we didn’t have to specify them. This is the default behaviour of all the read_ functions, so we don’t have to ask for it specially.\nExtra: in fact, if the top line of your data file is not variable names, that’s when you have to say something special. The read_ functions have an option col_names which can either be TRUE (the default), which means “read them in from the top line”, FALSE (“they are not there, so make some up”) or a list of column names to use. You might use the last alternative when the column names that are in the file are not the ones you want to use; in that case, you would also say skip=1 to skip the first line. For example, with file a.txt thus:\na b\n1 2\n3 4\n5 6\nyou could read the same data but call the columns x and y thus:\n\nread_delim(\"a.txt\", \" \", col_names = c(\"x\", \"y\"), skip = 1)\n\nRows: 3 Columns: 2\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \" \"\ndbl (2): x, y\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)"

The column called case identifies each particular run of a production line (scroll down to see that it gets to 27 as well). Though it is a number, it is an identifier variable and so should not be treated quantitatively. The other columns (variables) are scrap and speed (quantitative) and line (categorical). These indicate which production line was used for each run, the speed it was run at, and the amount of scrap produced.\nThis seems like an odd place to end this question, but later we’ll be using these data to draw some graphs.\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)"
